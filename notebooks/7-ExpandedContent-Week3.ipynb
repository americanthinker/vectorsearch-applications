    "The background material for this topic/notebook is covered in the [Week 3 Course Content](https://uplimit.com/course/rag-applications/session/session_clzlsa20a01di197e4tij7vgm/module/module_clzlsa9a702cy1dm671cg0xr0) section titled **Context Enrichment**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview\n",
    "---\n",
    "The concept of Context Enrichment became popularized with the advent of LLMs that could reason over ever-increasing context window sizes. Prior to 2022 most open-source Reader models were limited to a 512 token context window. From a vector search perspective, adding the Context Enrichment technique to your toolbox allows the best of both worlds, because you can figure out which chunk size works best for your embedding model/reranker combo and then expand the retrieved text chunk with surrounding context so that the Reader LLM has the additional context it needs to answer the user query. Though not the only reason, this technique is partly why setting the chunk overlap parameter to zero (when chunking your text into sentences) is a good call.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the process of creating an `expanded_content` field that you can add to an existing dataset, which can then be indexed onto your Weaviate cluster. \n",
    "- No need to create a new dataset, simpy use a prexisting dataset (i.e. `huberman_minilm_256.parquet`)\n",
    "- Group dataset episodes together by `video_id`.  Performing this step will ensure that all before and after text chunks are all from the same episode and there is no \"bleed-over\" into another episode.\n",
    "- Loop over each set of episode chunks and join pre-, current, and post- chunks together as a single string.  The window size can be set as a parameter.\n",
    "- Join each chunk to the original dataset as an additional `expanded_content` field.\n",
    "- Either index the new dataset on a new collection, or update an existing collection.  The properties file used to create the index schema on Weaviate already includes an `expanded_content` property. "

    "\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the first in our six-episode series all about sleep. Our expert guest for this series is Dr. Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology and the director of the Center for Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also the author of the bestselling book, Why We Sleep. During the course of the six-episode series, for which we release one episode per week, starting with this episode one, we cover essentially all aspects of sleep and provide numerous practical tools to improve your sleep. For instance, we discuss the biology of sleep, including the different sleep stages, as well as why sleep is so important for our mental and physical health. We also talk about how sleep regulates things like emotionality and learning and neuroplasticity, that is your brain's ability to change in response to experience. And we discuss the various things that you can do to improve your sleep. Everything from how to time lighting, temperature, exercise, eating, and the various things that can impact sleep both positively and negatively, such as alcohol, cannabis, and various supplements and drugs that have been shown to improve sleep. We also talk about naps, dreaming and the role of dreams, and lucid dreaming, which is when you dream and you are aware that you are dreaming. In today's episode one, we specifically focus on why sleep is so important and what happens when we do not get enough sleep or enough quality sleep. We also talk about the various sleep stages, and we also talk about a very specific formula that everyone should know for themselves called QQRT, which is an acronym that stands for quality, quantity, regularity, and timing of sleep. Four factors which today you'll learn how to identify specifically for you what your optimal QQRT is, and then to apply that in order to get the best possible night's sleep, which of course equates to the best possible level of focus and alertness throughout your days.

    "After you've indexed the data you will now have a way to retrieve content on a fine-grained level, and provide your LLM Reader with an expanded context.  You will be able to see this in action when you add `expanded_content` as a `return_property` in your Streamlit UI. 🎉  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the important idea here is how does adding expanded content affect your RAG system performance?  Assuming you completed Notebook 5 you now have the means at your disposal of running an evaluation with the Reader LLM ingesting the `expanded_content` field as context instead of the `content` field. Setting up your own evaluation will be a good exercise in understanding how all of these pieces are put together.  You'll note that the function used to build the user message at run time `generate_prompt_series` as well as the  `create_context_blocks` function have a `content_key` parameter.  You will want to pass in `expanded_content` as an argument here instead of `content`. "
