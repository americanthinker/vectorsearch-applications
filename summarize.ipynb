       "(\"digest everything that I've read now, I'm really struck by the idea that if we're evolving culturally, we need to be certain that we're not limiting ourselves based on previously held beliefs. So when I think about this, if there is something that could be designed into the system that would allow people to be more loosely connected, where they would have access to information that's otherwise quite difficult to come by, and that would lead to faster growth and development, if you're growing and evolving at a faster rate, rates of self-evolution, you're more likely to be able to solve problems. So I think consumer capitalism, and I'm going to speak pretty roughly here, but it fixates people on things that are, they're not purpose built to solve. So the reason that I think is this immersion in consumer capitalism is leading people away from their sense of purpose, and it's making them less happy, and it's putting them into a position where they're less capable of solving problems. So when I think about all of this, and I think about my goal, which is to hopefully contribute to human cooperation and solving the world's biggest problems, it's so interesting to me to think that if the things that you're talking about are true, and there is a way to design that in, that would be absolutely extraordinary. Now, I'm not saying that's true, but if it is, that could be extraordinary. And it would help us solve all of these big problems that otherwise seem to be quite intractable. So, I don't know. I'm definitely going to look further into all of this. Vishen, thank you so much for coming on the show. I know we didn't get to talk about a weighty of things, but this, I think, was really interesting. I'm going to encourage everybody listening to take a really deep dive into this, especially if there's information that could make you more capable of solving the world's biggest problems. That just seems absolutely extraordinary. So, Vishen, thank you so much for coming on the show. And guys, definitely take a look at the show notes. I'm going to be listing all of the books and everything that Vishen and I discussed so that you guys can do a deep dive. So, Vishen, thank you again for coming on the show.

      "SUMMARY: In this episode of Impact Theory, host Tom Bilyeu interviews James Nestor, author of the book \"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art.\" Nestor discusses the surprising discoveries he made while researching the topic of breathing. He explains that humans are anatomically predisposed to breathe improperly due to the evolution of our faces and mouths, which have become smaller over time. This has led to respiratory issues such as sleep apnea and snoring.

The implications of these issues on our overall health are significant, as improper breathing has been linked to various maladies, including metabolic problems, diabetes, anxiety, hypertension, gut problems, and asthma.

      "SUMMARY: In this episode of Impact Theory, host Tom Bilyeu interviews Dr. Moriel Zelikowsky, an assistant professor of neurobiology at the University of Utah. Dr. Zelikowsky's research focuses on neural circuits involved in emotion, particularly social isolation. She explains that she was drawn to the science of emotion because of its clinical relevance and the potential to find cures or treatments for various conditions. She initially studied fear and memory, exploring how traumatic experiences are stored in memory and affect future interactions. Dr. Zelikowsky's current work involves studying the effects of social isolation on the brain and behavior of mice. She explains that mice are highly social animals, and isolation for an extended period of time leads to increased aggression, persistent fear responses, and difficulties in mating and social interactions. Dr. Zelikowsky's lab is particularly interested in the neuropeptide tachykinin-2, which is upregulated in the brain following social isolation. This neuropeptide plays a role in coordinating the brain's response to isolation, but its exact function and effects are still being studied. The duration of isolation required to observe these effects in mice is about two weeks, but it is unclear how long it takes for similar effects to manifest in humans. Dr. Zelikowsky also discusses the potential impact of social media and the presence of a small support group on mitigating the effects of isolation. She emphasizes the importance of fear as an adaptive response, helping individuals recognize and respond to dangerous situations. However, excessive fear and anxiety can be detrimental, impairing decision-making and cognitive function. Dr. Zelikowsky explains that exposure therapy is a common treatment for PTSD and other anxiety disorders, involving the repeated exposure to traumatic cues or experiences in a controlled environment. Overall, the episode provides insights into the neuroscience of fear, the effects of social isolation, and potential therapeutic approaches for anxiety-related conditions.\n",

      "GUEST: Cal Newport\n",
      "SUMMARY: In this episode, the guest, Cal Newport, discusses the negative effects of social media use on mental health. He highlights two main issues: social snacking and social comparison. Social snacking refers to the replacement of high-quality face-to-face interactions with low-friction online interactions, which ultimately leads to a lack of meaningful connections. Social comparison, on the other hand, involves constantly comparing oneself to carefully curated positive portrayals of others' lives, leading to decreased happiness. The host then shifts the conversation to discuss Newport's book, \"So Good They Can't Ignore You,\" which challenges the common advice of following one's passion. Newport argues that most people do not have a clearly identifiable passion and that connecting a job to a preexisting interest does not necessarily lead to job satisfaction. Instead, he suggests that becoming excellent at a skill and building mastery can lead to passion and fulfillment in one's career. The conversation then delves into the concept of deliberate practice, which Newport explains is necessary for deep work and achieving mastery. He emphasizes the importance of stretching oneself beyond comfort zones and training the ability to concentrate intensely.
