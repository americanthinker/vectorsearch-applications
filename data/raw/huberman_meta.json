    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. E.J. Chichilnisky, Ph.D., a professor of neurosurgery and ophthalmology at Stanford University. He studies how we see and uses that information to build artificial eyes that restore vision to the blind. \n\nWe discuss how understanding the retina (the light-sensing brain tissue that lines the back of our eyes) is critical to knowing how our brain works more generally. \n\nWe discuss brain augmentation with biologically informed prostheses, robotics, and AI and what this means for medicine and humanity. \n\nWe also discuss E.J.\u2019s unique journey into neuroscience and how changing fields multiple times, combined with some wandering, taught him how to guide his decision-making in all realms of life. \n\nThis episode ought to be of interest to anyone interested in learning how the brain works from a world-class neuroscientist, those interested in the future of brain therapeutics and people seeking inspiration and tools for navigating their own professional and life journey.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. E.J.

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Becky Kennedy, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, bestselling author, and founder of Good Inside, an education platform for parents and parents-to-be. We discuss actionable protocols for raising resilient, emotionally healthy kids and effective alternatives to typical forms of reward and punishment that instead teach children valuable skills and strengthen the parent-child bond. These protocols also apply to other types of relationships: professional, romantic, friendships, siblings, etc. \n\nWe explain how to respond to emotional outbursts, rudeness, and entitlement, repair fractured relationships, build self-confidence, and improve interpersonal connections with empathy while maintaining healthy boundaries. \n\nWe also discuss how to effectively communicate with children and adults with ADHD, anxiety, learning challenges, or with \u201cdeeply feeling\u201d individuals. \n\nThe conversation is broadly applicable to all types of social interactions and bonds. By the end of the episode, you will have learned simple yet powerful tools to build healthy relationships with kids, teens, adults, and oneself.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMate\u00edna: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Becky Kennedy\nGood Inside website: https://www.goodinside.com \nTED talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_kennedy_the_single_most_important_parenting_strategy \nGood Inside book: https://www.goodinside.com/book\nPodcast: https://www.goodinside.com/podcast\nNewsletter:  https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drbeckyatgoodinside \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@drbeckyatgoodinside \n\nJournal Articles\nThe tenacious brain: How the anterior mid-cingulate contributes to achieving goals: https://bit.ly/48p5SZW\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: How to Understand Emotions: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-lisa-feldman-barrett-how-to-understand-emotions \nThe Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body \n\nPeople Mentioned\nGabor Mat\u00e9: physician and author: https://drgabormate.com\nRonald Fairburn: psychiatrist and psychoanalyst: https://psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/ronald-fairbairn\nJames Hollis: Jungian psychoanalyst and author: https://jameshollis.net/welcome.htm\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Becky Kennedy\n00:02:44 Sponsors: Mate\u00edna, Joovv & AeroPress\n00:07:35 Healthy Relationships: Sturdiness, Boundaries & Empathy\n00:14:34 Tool: Establishing Boundaries\n00:18:24 Rules, Boundaries & Connection\n00:22:19 Rewards & Punishments; Skill Building\n00:29:48 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:16 Kids & Inherent Good\n00:34:06 Family Jobs, Validation & Confidence, Giving Hope\n00:41:54 Rewards, Pride\n00:44:48 Tool: \u201cI Believe You\u201d, Confidence & Safety; Other Relationships\n00:52:15 Trauma, Aloneness & Repair\n00:57:07 Tool: Repair & Apologies, Rejecting Apology\n01:01:04 Tool: Good Apologies\n01:03:35 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:04:37 Tool: Rudeness & Disrespect, Most Generous Interpretation\n01:12:32 Walking on Eggshells, Pilot Analogy & Emotional Outbursts, Sturdy Leadership\n01:20:49 Deeply Feeling Kids; Fears, Sensory Overload\n01:30:10 Co-Parenting Differences & Punishment\n01:37:11 Tool: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); Meditation\n01:41:20 Tool: Tolerating Frustration, Screen Time, Learning\n01:51:57 Grace & Parenthood, Parenting Job Description; Relationship to Self\n01:55:24 Tool: \u201cI\u2019m Noticing\u201d, Asking Questions; Emotional Regulation\n02:01:15 Adolescence & Critical Needs, Explorers vs. Nomads\n02:09:58 Saying \u201cI Love You\u201d, Teenagers; Family Meetings\n02:15:07 Self-Care, Rage & Boundaries; Sturdy Leaders; Parent Relationship & Conflict\n02:22:08 Tool: Wayward Teens, Marijuana & Substance Use, Getting Additional Help\n02:30:03 Mentors\n02:34:26 Tool: Entitlement, Fear & Frustration\n02:41:57 Tool: Experiencing Frustration; Chores & Allowance\n02:46:31 Good Inside Platform\n02:51:27 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Parenting #Relationships\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Mark D'Esposito, M.D., a neurologist and professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying cognition and the forms of memory required for focus, productivity, planning and achieving goals, and learning. We discuss neurochemicals such as dopamine and acetylcholine and how they can be leveraged to improve cognitive functioning. We also discuss concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, and ways to restore or slow cognitive decline by using pharmacologic, lifestyle and behavioral protocols. This episode provides a modern understanding of cognition and memory and actionable tools to optimize brain health and function.\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/hubmerman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\n*Dr. Mark D'Esposito*\nAcademic profile: https://bit.ly/49wwPMo \nLab website: https://bit.ly/3I4Sxev \nBrainHealth project: https://bit.ly/3SEiZ3w \nPublications: https://bit.ly/3T4AH1J \nX: https://twitter.com/mtdespo \n\n*Journal Articles*\nCognitive and attentional mechanisms in delay of gratification: https://bit.ly/49zpHPL\nInverted-U\u2013Shaped Dopamine Actions on Human Working Memory and Cognitive Control: https://bit.ly/3UdfWBP\nCognitive Deficit Caused by Regional Depletion of Dopamine in Prefrontal Cortex of Rhesus Monkey: https://bit.ly/4bBqMI9\nClinical experience with the \u03b12A-adrenoceptor agonist, guanfacine, and N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of cognitive deficits in \u201cLong-COVID19\u201d: https://bit.ly/42IuviW\nEstrogen Shapes Dopamine-Dependent Cognitive Processes: Implications for Women's Health: https://bit.ly/42G4xwF\nOngoing dynamics in large-scale functional connectivity predict perception: https://bit.ly/3SMFT92\n\n*Other Resources*\nBrainHQ: https://bit.ly/3I6y5d6\nThe BrainHealth Project: https://bit.ly/3I591Dm \nNeuroscouting: https://bit.ly/42IpZB8 \n\n*Huberman Lab Episodes Mentioned*\nNicotine's Effects on the Brain & Body & How to Quit Smoking or Vaping: https://go.hubermanlab.com/GpyRhoQTYT\nTools to Enhance Working Memory & Attention: https://go.hubermanlab.com/s7LQP1bsYT \nDr. Matthew Walker: The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep: https://go.hubermanlab.com/psVAPrDqYT \nHow Psilocybin Can Rewire Our Brain, Its Therapeutic Benefits & Its Risks: https://go.hubermanlab.com/ggl7TvJuYT \n\n*People Mentioned*\nBrian Levine: Professor Dept. of Psychology, University of Toronto: https://bit.ly/49h05qz\nMatthew Walker: Professor of Neuroscience & Psychology, UC Berkeley: https://bit.ly/3UK2Ags\nMichael Merzenich: Professor Emeritus - Neuroscience, USCF: https://bit.ly/3T4rSoD\nDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel: Nobel Prize (1981): https://bit.ly/3T6SPYQ\nEmily Jacobs: Associate Professor of Psychology, UC Santa Barbara: https://bit.ly/3T0AaOa\nArt Kramer: Professor Emeritus, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign: https://bit.ly/48l4982\nEddie Chang: Professor of Neurological Surgery, UCSF: https://bit.ly/3SLsjmd\nKarl Deisseroth: Professor and Psychiatrist, Stanford: https://stanford.io/49BQmuG\nSepideh Sadaghiani: Associate Professor of Psychology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign: https://bit.ly/48CagoF\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Mark D\u2019Esposito\n00:02:08 Sponsors: Maui Nui, Joovv & Eight Sleep\n00:06:23 Brain & Frontal Lobes, Prefrontal Cortex, Executive Function\n00:10:31 Frontal Lobe Development, Children\n00:14:12 Rules, Context & Impulse Control; Learning & Goals\n00:21:45 Focus, Improving Executive Function\n00:26:04 Connections & Top-Down Signals\n00:29:02 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:29 Frontal Lobe Injury; Emotional Regulation\n00:37:26 Smartphones, Social Media\n00:44:37 Working Memory, Dopamine\n00:52:59 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:54:22 Dopamine Levels & Working Memory, Cognitive Tasks, Genetics\n01:00:03 Bromocriptine & Working Memory, Dopamine\n01:06:21 Guanfacine, Neurotransmitter Levels, Pupil Dilation & Biomarker Tests\n01:12:46 Bromocriptine, Olympics; Pharmacology & Cognitive Function, Adderall\n01:19:27 Concussion, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n01:25:22 Sleep, TBI, Concussion & Executive Function; BrainHQ\n01:31:57 Aging & Frontal Executive System; Brain Health\n01:39:26 Tools: Brain Health & Boosting Executive Function, Books\n01:47:26 Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Genetics, Pharmacology\n01:51:48 Parkinson\u2019s Disease, L-Dopa; Coping with Alzheimer\u2019s; Nicotine\n01:58:37 Estrogen & Dopamine, Cognition; Tool: Physical Exercise\n02:04:43 Tool: Mindfulness Meditation & Executive Function\n02:10:31 Brain Networks; Modularity\n02:17:08 Modularity, Brain Indices\n02:22:53 Psilocybin; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\n02:30:16 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We cover how sleep affects our hormones, immune system, learning and memory, mood, appetite, and weight regulation.\n\nWe also discuss what causes the urge to sleep, how sleep is structured throughout the night, and the biology of the different phases of sleep. We also teach you how to determine your individualized sleep needs, including your chronotype (best waking and to-bed time), tips for combat snoring and insomnia, and your QQRT (Quality, Quantity, Regularity, and Timing)\u2014a key framework for optimizing your sleep and therefore daytime energy and focus, and overall health.\n\nThe next episode in this special series explores how to improve one\u2019s sleep.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Matthew Walker\nWebsite: https://www.sleepdiplomat.com \nPodcast: https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/podcast \n\"Why We Sleep\": https://amzn.to/4a9Tyyl \nAcademic profile: https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/matthew-p-walker \nX: https://twitter.com/sleepdiplomat \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/drmattwalker \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sleepdiplomat \nMasterClass: https://www.masterclass.com/classes/matthew-walker-teaches-the-science-of-better-sleep \n\nJournal Articles\nCoordinated human sleeping brainwaves map peripheral body glucose homeostasis: https://bit.ly/4agGuHn\nPartial sleep deprivation reduces natural killer cell activity in humans: https://bit.ly/43HpnMC\nDaylight Saving Time and Acute Myocardial Infarction: A Meta-Analysis: https://bit.ly/49kVmDs\nSleepy Punishers Are Harsh Punishers: Daylight Saving Time and Legal Sentences: https://bit.ly/4agG83F\nEffects of insufficient sleep on circadian rhythmicity and expression amplitude of the human blood transcriptome: https://bit.ly/3xlbHed\nA systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between sleep duration/quality, mental toughness and resilience amongst healthy individuals: https://bit.ly/3TLsiz4\nNegative effects of restricted sleep on facial appearance and social appeal: https://bit.ly/3xnbGGB\nSleep regularity is a stronger predictor of mortality risk than sleep duration: A prospective cohort study: https://bit.ly/4cz6bEG\n\nOther Resources\nTED Talk: https://bit.ly/43Lk66B \nChronotype Calculator: https://bit.ly/43MFlFk\n\nPeople Mentioned\nAllan Rechtschaffen: sleep research pioneer: https://bit.ly/3U1nQxu\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Importance of Sleep\n00:02:24 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, BetterHelp & LMNT\n00:06:00 Sleep; Non-REM & REM Sleep\n00:11:40 Sleep Cycles, Individuality, Women vs. Men\n00:14:49 Tool: Wakefulness in Bed, Insomnia\n00:19:08 Non-REM Stages of Sleep\n00:27:05 Role of Deep Sleep\n00:34:02 Sponsor: AG1\n00:35:15 Light Sleep Stages, Hypnogogic Jerks\n00:42:00 REM Sleep, Paralysis & Bizarre Dreams; \u201cFalling\u201d Asleep\n00:49:09 Tools: Body Position & Sleep; Snoring & Sleep Apnea\n00:57:43 Yawning & Theories, Contagion\n01:04:03 Nodding Off, Afternoon & Postprandial Dip\n01:08:46 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:09:51 Sleep, Animals & Evolution \n01:14:09 Poor Sleep & Health Consequences, Sleep Deprivation\n01:27:13 Positive Effects of Good Sleep, Health Improvements\n01:31:56 Sleep & Mood; Appetite & Weight Management\n01:42:55 Sleep Deprivation & Looking Tired, \u201cBeauty Sleep\u201d\n01:47:57 Tool: Getting Good Sleep, QQRT Macros, Quantity & Quality\n01:56:45 Tool: Sleep Regularity, Mortality Risk\n02:03:15 Tool: Sleep Timing, Chronotypes\n02:14:21 Chronotypes & Insomnia, Circadian Rhythm, Shift Work\n02:20:31 Tool: Sleep Tests, Alarm Clock, Micro-Sleeps\n02:27:27 Sleep Inertia & Waking; Afternoon Dip, Optimum Performance\n02:34:19 Causes of Sleep: Circadian Rhythm, Sleep Pressure\n02:43:02 Adenosine & Sleepiness\n02:46:13 Tool: Growth Hormone & Deep Sleep\n02:50:47 Cortisol & Circadian Rhythm, \u201cTired But Wired\u201d\n02:57:24 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Sleep\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

I discuss peptides for improving tissue rejuvenation and repair, promoting longevity, improving muscle growth and fat loss, and boosting mood, vitality, and libido. I explain the biology of how these peptides work and both their potential benefits and risks. I also discuss peptide sourcing, dosages, cycling, routes of administration, and how peptides work in combination. \n\nThis episode will help you better understand the rapidly expanding landscape of peptide therapeutics and how to evaluate if specific peptides might be advantageous towards achieving your physical or mental health goals.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nMate\u00edna: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nJournal Articles\nGastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 accelerates healing of transected rat Achilles tendon and in vitro stimulates tendocytes growth: https://bit.ly/3TYHRoB\nGastric pentadecapeptide body protection compound BPC 157 and its role in accelerating musculoskeletal soft tissue healing: https://bit.ly/3xcwRLc\nModulatory effects of BPC 157 on vasomotor tone and the activation of Src-Caveolin-1-endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway: https://go.nature.com/43DYYz2\nStable Gastric Pentadecapeptide BPC 157 and Wound Healing: https://bit.ly/3J0sS77\nInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1): a growth hormone: https://bit.ly/43WpDaN\nMK-677, an Orally Active Growth Hormone Secretagogue, Reverses Diet-Induced Catabolism1: https://bit.ly/3PInRnA\nTwo-Month Treatment of Obese Subjects with the Oral Growth Hormone (GH) Secretagogue MK-677 Increases GH Secretion, Fat-Free Mass, and Energy Expenditure: https://bit.ly/3PJKrfB\nKisspeptin signalling and its roles in humans: https://bit.ly/4cBfMeh\nAge-Related Changes of the Pineal Gland in Humans: A Digital Anatomo-Histological Morphometric Study on Autopsy Cases with Comparison to Predigital-Era Studies: https://bit.ly/3TGYzHv\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Natalie Crawford: Female Hormone Health, Fertility & Vitality: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-natalie-crawford-female-hormone-health-fertility-vitality \nDr. Michael Eisenberg: Improving Male Sexual Health, Function & Fertility: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-michael-eisenberg-improving-male-sexual-health-function-fertility \nThe Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-how-to-optimize-testosterone-and-estrogen \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Peptides\n00:03:20 Sponsors: Mate\u00edna, Levels & Joovv \n00:07:44 What is a Peptide?, Effects\n00:12:06 Peptide Sourcing, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\n00:14:48 Rejuvenation & Tissue Repair: BPC-157, Angiogenesis\n00:21:50 BPC-157 & Tissue Injury; Mode of Delivery\n00:27:53 BPC-157: Safety, Doses, Cycling, Tumor Risk\n00:35:16 Sponsor: AG1\n00:36:43 Tissue Repair: Thymosin Beta-4, TB-500\n00:40:49 Growth & Metabolism: Growth Hormone, IGF-1, Risks\n00:45:25 Secretagogues, Sermorelin, Tesamorelin, CJC-1295\n00:52:21 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:53:44 Ipamorelin, Hexarelin, GHRP-3, MK-677; Risks & Timing\n00:58:69 Peptides for Growth Hormone & IGF-1, Risk; Combinations & Dosing\n01:06:12 Longevity: Thymosin Beta-4, Epitalon (Epithalon)\n01:12:09 Vitality: Melanotan, PT-141 (Vyleesi), Risks\n01:17:21 Vitality: Kisspeptin\n01:21:46 Peptides, Potential Benefits, Side-Effects & Risks\n01:24:19 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Health\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.\n\nHuberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\n\nIf you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023.\n\nIf you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-16-sleep-vertigo-tbi-ocd-tips-for-travelers-gut-brain-axis-more\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:02:34 Achieving Key Health Pillars While Traveling\n00:07:11 Improving Sleep Quality\n00:13:11 Understanding and Managing Vertigo\n00:20:44 Enhancing Brain Function Post-TBI\n00:26:58 Getting Closer to Unraveling OCD\n00:30:44 Adjusting Circadian Rhythms for Travel\n00:34:58 Optimal Dosage for Fish Oil Supplements\n00:40:17 Monitoring Hormone Levels\n00:46:09 Optimizing the Gut-Brain Axis\n00:52:04 Best Practices for Tongue Cleaning\n00:56:36 Conclusion & Thank You\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #AMA\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Kay Tye, PhD, Professor of Systems Neurobiology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator. We discuss the neural circuit basis of social interactions and loneliness. We also discuss how animals and people establish themselves in a group hierarchy by rank and how the brain responds to dominance and subordination. \n\nMuch of our discussion relates to how social media impacts our sense of social connectedness or lack thereof. The topics covered in this episode are directly relevant to anyone interested in the neuroscience of mental health, work-life balance, abundance versus scarcity mindset, and interpersonal dynamics.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Kay Tye\nAcademic profile: https://www.salk.edu/scientist/kay-tye\nLab website: https://tyelab.org \nHHMI profile: https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/kay-tye \nPublications: https://tyelab.org/publications\nTED talk: https://www.ted.com/speakers/kay_tye \nX: https://twitter.com/kaymtye \n\nJournal Articles\nInput-specific control of reward and aversion in the ventral tegmental area: https://go.nature.com/3ubT3nT\nExtraneous factors in judicial decisions: https://bit.ly/3SLZiqL\nTotal social isolation in monkeys: https://bit.ly/4bmL1Jo\nDorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons Represent the Experience of Social Isolation: https://bit.ly/4bAKtjk\nNeural mechanisms of social homeostasis: https://bit.ly/3OvNGXp\nThe neural circuitry of social homeostasis: Consequences of acute versus chronic social isolation: https://bit.ly/48WjRYa\nCortical ensembles orchestrate social competition through hypothalamic outputs: https://go.nature.com/4bmL73I\n\nOther Resources\nThe Eisenhower Matrix: How to prioritize your to-do list: https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix \nChimp Empire (Netflix series): https://www.netflix.com/title/81311783 \nAdvice for a Young Investigator: https://amzn.to/3HO6tJU\nNIH Human Connectome Project (HCP): https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/human-connectome/connectome-programs \n\nPeople Mentioned\nS.M.: patient with bilateral amygdala damage: https://w.wiki/5N3g\nHarry Harlow: Psychologist, known for his social isolation experiments in monkeys: https://w.wiki/9562\nMarkus Meister: Professor of Biological Science at Caltech: https://bit.ly/3Osn3Ta\nBen Barres: Neuroscientist at Stanford: https://stan.md/3HMBxtl\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Kay Tye\n00:02:39 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & LMNT\n00:06:40 Amygdala; \u201cValence\u201d \n00:12:43 Novelty; Reward & Punishment Response\n00:20:06 Amygdala & Hunger; Social Interaction\n00:26:21 Social Media & Social Connection; Tool: Email & Time Management\n00:35:03 Sponsor: AG1\n00:36:30 Social Media; Friction & Feedback, Leadership\n00:43:44 Social Isolation, Harlow Experiments, \u201cLoneliness Neurons\u201d\n00:51:47 Social Homeostasis, COVID-19 Pandemic & Loneliness\n01:01:29 Quality of Social Contact, Social Homeostasis, Social Media\n01:08:40 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:09:42 Social Media, Relationships; Social Isolation & Exclusion\n01:18:26 Empathy: Friend vs. Foe\n01:28:40 Background & Empathy, Diversity, Emotional Regulation\n01:34:34 Abundance vs. Scarcity Mindset\n01:37:22 Social Rank & Hierarchy, Sibling Order, Development\n01:45:54 Dynamic Hierarchy; Dominants vs. Subordinates; Mentors\n01:55:32 Psychedelics: Research & Mechanisms; Psilocybin \n02:06:28 Work-Life Balance, Fitness & Extracurriculars\n02:11:56 Personal Life, Diversity, Happiness; Typical Day\n02:15:42 Science & Academia; Future Directions\n02:23:48 Research & Science Outreach\n02:28:48 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Emotions\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

I discuss how your beliefs and expectation that a certain outcome will occur after taking a substance (or any intervention cause genuine changes in brain and bodily function. I discuss how placebos can change neurotransmitter and hormone release, pain levels, whether the stress response is beneficial or detrimental and more. I also explain how placebo effects can work with traditional drug or behavioral treatments to help improve health outcomes and why some people are more susceptible to placebo effects. By the end of the episode, listeners will understand the placebo effect, how it works, and how beliefs and mindsets can be leveraged toward mental health, physical health, and performance goals. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX (formerly Twitter): https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nJournal Articles\nExpectation and Dopamine Release: Mechanism of the Placebo Effect in Parkinson's Disease: https://bit.ly/3IrhjWc\nConscious Expectation and Unconscious Conditioning in Analgesic, Motor, and Hormonal Placebo/Nocebo Responses: https://bit.ly/49TSlKY\nImpact of brand or generic labeling on medication effectiveness and side effects: https://bit.ly/3IkUWSn\nDEMONSTRATION TO MEDICAL STUDENTS OF PLACEBO RESPONSES AND NON-DRUG FACTORS: https://bit.ly/3IofHws\nEffect of capsule colour and order of administration of hypnotic treatments: https://bit.ly/3TiZG1k\nEffect of colour of drugs: systematic review of perceived effect of drugs and of their effectiveness: https://bit.ly/3P4vF2G\nDo medical devices have enhanced placebo effects?: https://bit.ly/3P4vJPY\nPlacebo Effects in Oncology: https://bit.ly/3TkNOMc\nActive Albuterol or Placebo, Sham Acupuncture, or No Intervention in Asthma: https://bit.ly/3T4Kfsf\nNicotine-related beliefs induce dose-dependent responses in the human brain: https://go.nature.com/3V15yNM\nMind over milkshakes: Mindsets, not just nutrients, determine ghrelin response: https://bit.ly/42ZKnhe\nMind-Set Matters: Exercise and the Placebo Effect: https://bit.ly/3IkV7Nx\nA central master driver of psychosocial stress responses in the rat: https://bit.ly/3uJSBgU\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nNicotine's Effects on the Brain & Body & How to Quit Smoking or Vaping: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/nicotines-effects-on-the-brain-and-body-and-how-to-quit-smoking-or-vaping \nDr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health & Performance: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-alia-crum-science-of-mindsets-for-health-performance \n\nPeople Mentioned\nIvan Pavlov: physiologist, developed the conditioned reflex concept: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1904/pavlov/biographical\nTed Kaptchuk: Harvard, professor of medicine, studies placebo effects: https://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/ted-jack-kaptchuk\nAlia Crum: Stanford, professor of psychology, studies mindset and belief effects: https://profiles.stanford.edu/alia-crum\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Placebo Effects\n00:02:40 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, AeroPress & Levels\n00:07:24 Placebo, Nocebo vs. Belief Effect, Prefrontal Cortex\n00:14:03 Dopamine, Placebo & Parkinson\u2019s Disease; Placebo Controls \n00:21:36 Hormone Release & Placebo Effect, Paired Associations\n00:28:52 Conditioning Effect & Insulin; Pavlovian Response\n00:32:50 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:17 Context & Expectations; Placebo Effect & Brain\n00:40:51 Cancer, Mind-Body Practices; Placebo Effects & Limits\n00:44:54 Asthma, Specificity & Placebo Effects\n00:48:01 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:49:03 Nicotine & Dose-Dependent Placebo Effects\n00:55:31 Placebo Effects vs. Belief Effects, Food & Mindset\n01:01:02 Exercise & Belief Effects\n01:04:08 Placebo Effect, Brain & Stress Response\n01:11:18 Individual Variation, Genetics & Placebo Effect\n01:16:11 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Placebo\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

He's one of the world\u2019s top magicians and mentalists. \n\nWe discuss what magic and mentalism reveal about the human mind, including how memories are made, how to erase them, and how and why we perceive things the way we do, all in the context of how he performs his astonishing tricks. \n\nAsi explains that magic works because it involves storytelling, which is key to how we organize memories. He also explains how emotional connection allows people to co-create and believe a common narrative, even one that did not actually occur. \n\nWe also discuss how Asi's love of painting and photography and his specific daily routine allow him to access creativity.

I explain science-supported protocols for strengthening your teeth and gums, including how to remineralize your teeth. I cover the best approaches and timing for brushing and flossing, tongue, gum, and oral microbiome care and how oral health is critically important to offset metabolic, cardiac, and brain diseases, including dementia. I also discuss proper nutrition for oral health, fluoride, and how sugar and mouth breathing can accelerate tooth decay. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone seeking to improve their physical health, mental health, and lifespan, given the critical role that oral health plays in all of these.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMateina: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nHow to Optimize Your Water Quality & Intake for Health: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-optimize-your-water-quality-and-intake-for-health\nFluoride in Water (timestamp): https://youtu.be/at37Y8rKDlA?si=DgET0UUH3p_HVBWm&t=5375 \nWhat Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain & Health: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-brain-health \nThe Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body  \nDr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain & Repair Gut Health: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-justin-sonnenburg-how-to-build-maintain-and-repair-gut-health \n\nOther Resources\nZero fluoride toothpastes on Amazon: https://amzn.to/4bBFHSo\nZellies\u2019s Xylitol (no affiliation): https://zellies.com/collections\nBi\u00f6m (no affiliation): https://betterbiom.com\nFygg (no affiliation): https://fygg.com\n\nPeople Mentioned and Special Thanks To\nDr. Anastacia (\"Staci\") Whitman (Instagram): https://www.instagram.com/doctor_staci\nDr. Mark Burheene (Instagram): https://www.instagram.com/askthedentist\n@BowTiedGatorDDS (X/Twitter): https://twitter.com/BowTiedGatorDDS\nDr. Kathryn Mueller (Instagram)\u200d: https://www.instagram.com/kathrynm_fit\nDr. Ellie Phillips: https://drellie.com\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Oral Health\n00:03:28 Sponsors: Mateina, ROKA & Helix Sleep\n00:07:13 Oral Health Quiz\n00:13:53 Teeth Biology, Cavity Repair\n00:20:01 Mouth, Gums, Saliva\n00:27:23 Sponsor: AG1\n00:28:51 Cavity Formation, Bacteria, Sugar, Acidity\n00:35:10 Teeth Remineralization, Fluoride, Water\n00:42:57 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:43:58 Tools: The \u201cDo Nots\u201d of Oral Health, Mouth Breathing\n00:54:48 Tools: Fasting & Teeth Remineralization; Nighttime Toothbrushing\n01:03:23 Proper Teeth Brushing; Tooth Sensitivity & Gums\n01:08:16 Bacteria, Plaque & Tartar; Tooth Polishing \n01:11:02 Proper Flossing Technique, Waterpik; Children & Flossing\n01:14:23 Tool: Xylitol, Bacteria & Cavity Prevention\n01:19:43 Toothpastes: Xylitol, Fluoride, Hydroxyapatite\n01:22:38 Mouthwash & Alcohol, Antiseptic Mouthwash\n01:26:29 Tools: Baking Soda, Hydrogen Peroxide?, Salt Water Rinse\n01:32:36 Alcohol-Based Mouthwash, Nitric Oxide\n01:34:52 Tools: Canker Sore Prevention & Gut Microbiome; Sleep\n01:37:47 Tools: Tongue Brushing; Toothbrush Care\n01:41:38 Teeth Sealants; Metal Fillings, Mercury, Mastic Gum; Root Canals\n01:48:43 Dentist Visits, Daily Routines & Oral Health\n01:54:17 Practices for Oral Health, Oil Pulling\n01:58:21 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #OralHealth #Health\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss working memory, which is critical for learning and productivity, strategy setting, goal seeking, and navigating new environments. I explain the key role of dopamine and the biological mechanisms underlying working memory and how working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.\n\nI also describe science-supported tools to enhance working memory and attention\u2014including zero- or low-cost behavioral, supplemental and pharmacologic approaches. I include how to assess your working memory and how to use memory tasks to determine your baseline dopamine levels in certain brain circuits.\n\nThis episode provides listeners with highly actionable tools to assess and improve their attention to specific tasks and task-switching capacity and to enhance their overall productivity.\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMateina: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nBetterHelp:  https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\n*Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Journal Articles*\nWorking Memory Capacity Predicts Dopamine Synthesis Capacity in the Human Striatum: https://bit.ly/3UjmP4z\nInverted-U\u2013Shaped Dopamine Actions on Human Working Memory and Cognitive Control: https://bit.ly/3UdfWBP\nCognitive Deficit Caused by Regional Depletion of Dopamine in Prefrontal Cortex of Rhesus Monkey: https://bit.ly/49g3yW5\nThe dopamine agonist bromocriptine differentially affects fronto-striatal functional connectivity during working memory: https://bit.ly/3SyMjcY\nIncreased dopamine tone during meditation-induced change of consciousness: https://bit.ly/3QDfE53\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3HCniHC\nThe Effect of Binaural Beats on Visuospatial Working Memory and Cortical Connectivity: https://bit.ly/3SAFuHT\nTyrosine Improves Working Memory in a Multitasking Environment: https://bit.ly/48QQjv8\n\n*Resources*\nNSDR: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u&feature=shared\nThe Science & Use of Cold Exposure for Health & Performance: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wqrjXIsYYT\n\n*Huberman Lab Episodes Mentioned*\nUnderstand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools: https://go.hubermanlab.com/miohHKRSYT\nADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XReodaB9YT\nAdderall, Stimulants & Modafinil for ADHD: Short- & Long-Term Effects: https://go.hubermanlab.com/VS83tuCgYT\nLeverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort: https://go.hubermanlab.com/LgeyAbznYT\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WMwb80NkYT\n\n*People Mentioned*\nDonald Hebb: Psychologist, influential contributions to understanding of learning: https://bit.ly/4bbhXEx\nMark D\u2019Esposito: Psychology Professor at the University of California, Berkeley: https://bit.ly/3vRcFhj\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Working Memory\n00:01:12 Sponsors: Mateina, BetterHelp & Helix Sleep\n00:05:00 Short- vs. Long-Term Memory\n00:09:59 Neuroplasticity\n00:15:42 Working Memory; Attention & Focus\n00:20:04 Working Memory Test\n00:25:35 Sponsor: AG1\n00:27:02 Brain & Working Memory; Dopamine\n00:36:13 Working Memory Capacity Test\n00:44:37 Increasing Dopamine & Working Memory\n00:49:26 Task Switching, Distractions\n00:54:42 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:56:04 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Dopamine\n01:03:08 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n01:11:02 Tool: Working Memory & Binaural Beats\n01:15:23 Supplements to Increase Dopamine: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n01:22:53 Dopamine Prescriptions, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\n01:29:12 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors,  Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Memory\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

I also dispel common myths about how the cold and flu are transmitted and when you and those around you are contagious. \n\nI explain if common preventatives and treatments such as vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D and echinacea work. I also highlight other compounds known to reduce contracting and duration of colds and flu. \n\nI discuss how to use exercise and sauna to bolster the immune response. \n\nThis episode will help listeners understand how to reduce the chances of catching a cold or flu and help people recover more quickly from and prevent the spread of colds and flu.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nArticles\nA social chemosignaling function for human handshaking: https://go.hubermanlab.com/eWMWr5T6YT\nThere is chemistry in social chemistry: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wIjg4eIiYT\nAlterations in Oral\u2013Nasal\u2013Pharyngeal Microbiota and Salivary Proteins in Mouth-Breathing Children: https://go.hubermanlab.com/pww3thWHYT\nHuman nasal microbiota: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XWfDZyZBYT\nHow (and why) the immune system makes us sleep: https://go.hubermanlab.com/TL09NaWxYT\nThe compelling link between physical activity and the body's defense system: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XXvkR83eYT\nThe effects of a single and a series of Finnish sauna sessions on the immune response and HSP-70 levels in trained and untrained men: https://go.hubermanlab.com/0uiWBVO5YT\nRetracted: Extra Dose of Vitamin C Based on a Daily Supplementation Shortens the Common Cold: A Meta-Analysis of 9 Randomized Controlled Trials: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WxCUtZmXYT\nVitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data: https://go.hubermanlab.com/POdJvqscYT\nAttenuation of influenza-like symptomatology and improvement of cell-mediated immunity with long-term N-acetylcysteine treatment: https://go.hubermanlab.com/TLcxQb74YT\n\nBooks\n\"Jaws: The Story of a Hidden Epidemic\": https://amzn.to/3TUXc9Z\n\nOther Resources\nNon-sleep Deep Rest (NSDR): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u&feature=shared\nToolkit for Sleep: https://go.hubermanlab.com/AEUHya3EYT\nFoundational Fitness Protocol: https://go.hubermanlab.com/fyv8uNAsYT\nDr. Roger Seheult (YouTube): https://youtu.be/fZ8rqZK_RiA\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Noam Sobel: How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health & Behavior: https://go.hubermanlab.com/HvLJaHqOYT\nSleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing: https://go.hubermanlab.com/KLIjm41TYT\nHow to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain & Overall Health: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WYUmGKSpYT\nTools for Managing Stress & Anxiety: https://go.hubermanlab.com/UMxC11EAYT\nDr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain & Repair Gut Health: https://go.hubermanlab.com/R1k012Z1YT\nFitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health: https://go.hubermanlab.com/PO8bdasCYT\nUsing Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System: https://go.hubermanlab.com/20F6rGcHYT\nGuest Series with Dr. Andy Galpin: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4N_PVVoq0Za03YKASSGCazr\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Avoid Colds & Flu\n00:01:58 Sponsors: Joovv, Helix Sleep & ROKA\n00:06:00 Common Cold: Source & Transmission; Cold Temperature Myth\n00:13:48 Spreading a Cold; Symptoms & Contagious Myths\n00:17:43 Flu Virus & Transmission; Flu Shots\n00:23:56 Tools: Injections & Safety; Charting Health Trends & Sickness\n00:27:16 Sponsor: AG1\n00:28:44 Spreading Cold & Flu, Symptoms\n00:30:43 Immune System, Physical Barriers\n00:39:33 Tool: Social Connection & Touch, Avoiding Flu & Cold\n00:45:14 Innate Immune System\n00:53:13 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:54:15 Adaptive Immune System; Lymphatic System\n01:00:19 Tools: Enhance Innate Immune System\n01:06:19 Tool: Microbiome & Nasal Breathing\n01:10:58 Tools: Enhance Gut Microbiome: Foods & Water Protocol\n01:16:13 Exercise When Feeling Sick?, Sleep\n01:21:39 Tool: Exercise & Preventing Sickness\n01:28:13 Exercise When Sleep Deprived?\n01:32:24 Tool: Exercise Recovery & Carbohydrates\n01:34:52 Tool: Sauna & Enhance Immune System\n01:42:20 Supplements: Vitamin C, Vitamin D\n01:50:58 Echinacea, Zinc\n01:55:08 N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Decongestants\n02:03:42 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

His clinical and research efforts focus on using advanced neurosciences, patient outcomes, biomarkers and informatics to treat pain.\n \nWe discuss what pain is at the level of the body and mind, pain thresholds, and the various causes of pain. We also discuss effective protocols for controlling and reducing pain, including the use of heat and cold, acupuncture, chiropractic, physical therapy, nutrition, and supplementation.\n\nWe also discuss how pain is influenced by our emotions, stress and memories, and practical tools to control one\u2019s psychological perception of pain.\n \nAnd we discuss pain medications, including the controversial use of opioids and the opioid crisis.\n\nThis episode will help people understand, manage, and control their pain as well as the pain of others.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Sean Mackey\nStanford academic profile: https://stanford.io/48TgiBz \nWebsite: https://drseanmackey.com \nPublications: https://stanford.io/3U1OiHY\nLab website: https://stan.md/3vKrrWY\nStanford Division of Pain Medicine: https://stan.md/47zT9Dh\nX: https://twitter.com/DrSeanMackey \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/seancmackey\n\nJournal Articles\nSwearing as a response to pain: https://bit.ly/3O32Tir\nPain Mechanisms: A New Theory: https://bit.ly/3SiUGcq\nSex differences in pain: a brief review of clinical and experimental findings: https://bit.ly/3ShAebP\nDiffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC).

First, we discuss a paper on how bright light exposure at sunrise and throughout the day and dark exposure at night independently improve mental health and can offset some of the major symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Then, we discuss an article that explores a novel class of immunotherapy treatments to combat cancer. We also discuss some of the new data on low-calorie sweeteners and if they are safe. This episode should be of interest to listeners curious about maximizing their vitality and longevity and to anyone seeking science-supported ways to improve mental health and lifespan.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nBetterHelp:  https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nJoovvv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Peter Attia\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nThe Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter\nEarly Medical: https://earlymedical.com \nX: https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD \n\nJournal Articles\nDay and night light exposure are associated with psychiatric disorders: an objective light study in greater than 85,000 people (first article discussed): https://go.nature.com/47aIZcp\nEarly evening light mitigates sleep compromising physiological and alerting responses to subsequent late evening light: https://go.nature.com/3S84JzV\nAbsence of Circadian Phase Resetting in Response to Bright Light Behind the Knees: https://bit.ly/3Sr4Qb1\nTime spent in outdoor light is associated with mood, sleep, and circadian rhythm-related outcomes: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study in over 400,000 UK Biobank participants: https://bit.ly/3Oe376l\nImproved Survival with Ipilimumab in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma (second article discussed): https://bit.ly/492TmzX\nUnderstanding the Warburg Effect: The Metabolic Requirements of Cell Proliferation: https://bit.ly/3OaZr5o\nScreening for the Lynch Syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer): https://bit.ly/3HqgjBx\nAutoimmunity Correlates With Tumor Regression in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Treated With Anti\u2013Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen-4: https://bit.ly/3U6G3KA\n\nOther Resources\nTuo: https://www.thetuolife.com \nLight Meter app (Google Play): https://bit.ly/3ubAIXL\nLight Meter app (App Store): https://apple.co/47GJivn\nCarbon app: https://www.joincarbon.com \nFluorescence & Mammals: https://nyti.ms/493aTYU\nDr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health & Performance: https://go.hubermanlab.com/nEZXQlCXYT\nSugar Substitutes: https://bit.ly/48IJR9e\nThe mechanisms of action for immune checkpoint inhibitors: https://bit.ly/3SqTi7v\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Peter Attia, Journal Club\n00:02:40 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, BetterHelp & Joovv \n00:07:14 Light, Dark & Mental Health; Retina \n00:11:16 Outdoor vs. Indoor Light, Cataracts, Sunglasses\n00:16:17 Tools: Sunrise & Sunsets, Circadian Rhythm; Midday Light\n00:24:55 Tools: Night & Light Exposure; Waking Before Sunrise\n00:31:05 Article #1, Light/Dark Exposure & Mental Health\n00:36:50 Sponsor: AG1\n00:38:18 Odds Ratio, Hazard Ratio\n00:45:43 Night vs. Daylight Exposure, Mental Health Disorders\n00:51:35 Major Depression & Light Exposure; Error Bars & Significance\n00:59:15 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:00:39 Prescriptions; Environmental & Artificial Light; Red Lights\n01:08:14 Nighttime Light Exposure; Sleep Trackers & Belief Effects\n01:13:54 Light Directionality, Phone, Night\n01:17:21 Light Wavelengths & Sensors; Sunglasses\n01:20:58 Hawthorne Effect, Reverse Causality, Genetics\n01:26:26 Artificial Sweeteners, Appetite\n01:31:16 Natural Light Cycles, Circadian Rhythm & Mental Health\n01:39:53 Article #2, Immune System & Cancer\n01:43:18 T-Cell Activation; Viruses\n01:50:41 Autoimmunity; Cancer & Immune System Evasion\n02:00:09 Checkpoint Inhibitors, CTLA-4\n02:06:45 Anti-CTLA-4 Study Drug (Ipilimumab), Melanoma \n02:12:07 Patient Population, Randomization, GP100\n02:18:09 Response Rate\n02:22:52 Overall Survival & Response \n02:28:38 Median Survival vs. Overall Survival, Drug Development\n02:35:45 Gender & Dose\n02:40:32 Adverse Events; Autoimmunity \n02:46:42 Pancreatic Cancer; Aging & Immune System Health\n02:53:57 Melanoma; Lynch Syndrome, Keytruda\n02:58:43 Immunotherapy & Cancer Treatment; Melanoma Risk\n03:06:26 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors,  Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Robert Lustig, M.D., neuroendocrinologist, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a bestselling author on nutrition and metabolic health. We address the \u201ccalories in- calories out\u201d (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition.

We also discuss the condition formerly called \u201cAsperger\u2019s.\u201d This episode ought to be highly relevant for anyone interested in child and human development, how social bonds form, and to those curious about autism and other spectrum conditions.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Karen Parker\nStanford academic profile: https://stan.md/3RjIkyY \nParker Lab website: https://stan.md/3NicqBV\nPublications: https://stan.md/3RkO5N1\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-parker-52485 \n\nJournal Articles\nPrenatal exposure to ultrasound waves impacts neuronal migration in mice: https://go.hubermanlab.com/ptyyU8HyYT\nLancet retracts 12-year-old article linking autism to MMR vaccines: https://go.hubermanlab.com/dsvVI1uTYT\nMother love: what turns it on?: https://go.hubermanlab.com/pdgfu9CEYT\nIntranasal oxytocin treatment for social deficits and biomarkers of response in children with autism: https://go.hubermanlab.com/a8XJjHAVYT\nIntranasal Oxytocin in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: https://go.hubermanlab.com/roEfpTB5YT\nThe effect of oxytocin nasal spray on social interaction in young children with autism: a randomized clinical trial: https://go.hubermanlab.com/JF1DoSnWYT\nAutism-associated biomarkers: test\u2013retest reliability and relationship to quantitative social trait variation in rhesus monkeys: https://go.hubermanlab.com/lw3BnJ47YT\nEarly Predictors of Impaired Social Functioning in Male Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta): https://go.hubermanlab.com/mGm2a7KEYT\nCerebrospinal fluid vasopressin and symptom severity in children with autism: https://go.hubermanlab.com/vKY2h2EVYT\nA randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial shows that intranasal vasopressin improves social deficits in children with autism: https://go.hubermanlab.com/CpRAxmCsYT\nProbiotic Therapy with Lactobacillus reuteri Rescues Social and Emotional Recognition Behavior in an Environmental Mouse Model of Autism: https://go.hubermanlab.com/5gXuKmcXYT\nOxytocin and the microbiome: https://go.hubermanlab.com/dsP3pfl8YT\nBalovaptan vs Placebo for Social Communication in Childhood Autism Spectrum Disorder: https://go.hubermanlab.com/8bT6VLhWYT\n\nArticles & Other Resources\nMAPS \u201cCan Ecstasy [MDMA] Treat Autism?\u201d: https://maps.org/news/media/can-ecstasy-treat-autism\nDr. Robert Malenka: How Your Brain's Reward Circuits Drive Your Choices (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-malenka-how-your-brains-reward-circuits-drive-your-choices \nAutism Speaks: https://www.autismspeaks.org \nChimp Empire (Netflix): https://www.netflix.com/title/81311783 \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Karen Parker\n00:01:30 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, LMNT & Aero Press\n00:06:25 Autism, Frequency, Diagnosis\n00:10:41 Early Interventions; Heritability & Autistic Traits\n00:13:00 Autistic Spectrums; Studying Autism\n00:21:29 Environment, Risk Factors & In Utero Development\n00:29:55 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:26 Oxytocin, Vasopressin, Social Behavior & Parent-Child Bonding\n00:43:24 Oxytocin in Humans; Social Features of Autism, Intranasal Oxytocin\n00:54:14 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:55:16 Oxytocin & Autism; Benefit & Risks\n01:06:30 Neuroplasticity & Autism; Early Intervention; Challenges of Early Diagnosis\n01:14:30 MDMA & Autism\n01:17:05 Vasopressin, Social Interaction; Voles & Parenthood\n01:27:07 Human Social Connection, Oxytocin Levels & Autism\n01:33:45 Primate Model of Social Impairment\n01:42:47 Preclinical Animal Models, Mouse & Primates\n01:47:11 Primates, Biomarkers & Social Connection; Vasopressin\n01:52:20 Vasopressin Levels & Autism, Children & In Utero\n02:03:06 Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) & Vasopressin; Urination; Alternative Therapies\n02:10:32 Intranasal Vasopressin, Children, Autism & Social Responsiveness\n02:19:15 Vasopressin & Social Connection, Mechanism & Future Studies\n02:26:35 Gut Microbiome & Vasopressin; Scientific Funding\n02:34:52 Vasopressin Pathways, Social Behavior, Autism\n02:43:00 Vaccine Theory & Autism; Immunology\n02:54:06 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Autism\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Robert Greene, multiple New York Times bestselling author and expert on human psychology and behavior both at the individual and group levels and in the context of relationships, careers, and society. We discuss how to find, pursue and achieve one\u2019s unique life purpose, and how to best learn from good and hard experiences along that journey. We discuss power dynamics in relationships, the different types of human communication and the interplay between seduction and vulnerability. We discuss how to find the right romantic partner, improve healthy self-awareness, the link between anxiety and creativity, and pick ideal mentors and role models. Robert also discusses his recent stroke and what he has learned from his near-death experience about motivation, urgency and appreciation for life. Listeners of all ages will benefit from Robert\u2019s insights on navigating the process of building a deeply purposeful life and enhancing one\u2019s relationship with the self, others and society. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nRobert Greene\nWebsite: https://powerseductionandwar.com \nBooks: https://powerseductionandwar.com/books\nBlog: https://powerseductionandwar.com/blog \nFacebook: https://Facebook.com/48LawsofPowerbook\nX: https://twitter.com/RobertGreene \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/robertgreeneofficial \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@robertgreene \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@RobertGreeneOfficial\n\nJournal Articles\nDistinct hypothalamic control of same- and opposite-sex mounting behaviour in mice: https://go.nature.com/46CqgWA\n\nBooks\n\"Mastery\": https://amzn.to/3QYMXhG\n\"Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences\": https://amzn.to/4a7wuR5\n\"Bone Games: Extreme Sports, Shamanism, Zen, and the Search for Transcendence\": https://amzn.to/3TbspW2\n\nOther Resources\n\"How To Find Your Perfect Partner\": https://youtu.be/CQv3XGPoe2I?feature=shared\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Robert Greene\n00:01:58 Sponsors: ROKA, Helix Sleep & Waking Up \n00:05:56 Mastery (The Book), Purpose\n00:08:26 Finding Purpose, Childhood, Learning & Emotional Engagement\n00:18:00 Early Interests, Delight & Discovery\n00:22:50 Love vs. Hate Experiences & Learning\n00:28:25 Self-Awareness, Frustration, Excitation\n00:31:47 Sponsor: AG1\n00:33:18 Sublime Experiences, Real vs. False; Authenticity & Time\n00:43:57 Power & Relationships; Purpose & Mastery\n00:55:51 Seduction, Vulnerability, Childhood\n01:07:04 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:08:05 Power Dynamics & Romance; Equality, Love Sublime & Connection\n01:18:42 Vulnerability in Relationships, Creativity; Social Media, Justice\n01:29:45 Outrage, Control, \u201cArt of Ignore\u201d\n01:33:50 Masculinity & Femininity\n01:42:16 Picking Role Models; Purpose & Mentor Relationship\n01:51:07 \u201cAlive\u201d Thinking; Anxiety & Creativity \n01:58:55 Convergent Interests & Romantic Relationships\n02:07:19 Self-Awareness, Core Values & Romantic Relationships\n02:15:27 Non-Verbal Communication & Relationships\n02:24:58 Eyes, Voice, Intuition & Seduction\n02:28:38 Virtual World, Social Skills, Non-Verbal Communication\n02:32:19 Self-Awareness & Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nuance\n02:41:43 Human Brain, Plasticity\n02:45:18 Stroke & Near-Death Experiences, Self, Time\n02:55:49 Appreciation & Near-Death Experience, Urgency\n03:01:36 \u201cDeath Ground\u201d & Urgency\n03:09:13 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #RobertGreene\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Adam Grant, Ph.D., a professor of organizational psychology at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in the science and practical steps for increasing motivation, maximizing and reaching our potential, and understanding how individuals and groups can best flourish. He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.\n\nFor the show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-adam-grant-how-to-unlock-your-potential-motivation-unique-abilities\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Adam Grant\nWebsite: https://adamgrant.net \nBooks: https://adamgrant.net/books\nPodcasts: https://adamgrant.net/podcasts\nAcademic profile: https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/grantad\nTED Talk: \u201cAre You a Giver or a Taker?\u201d: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker \nTED Talk: \u201c The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers\u201d: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamgrant \nX: https://twitter.com/adammgrant \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AdamMGrant \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@adamgrant \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Adam Grant\n00:01:37 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & Waking Up\n00:05:56 Procrastination & Emotion; Curiosity\n00:14:06 Creativity & Procrastination; Motivation\n00:20:48 Intrinsic Motivation & Curiosity\n00:27:59 Tool: Tasks & Sense of Purpose\n00:30:52 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:34 Extrinsic Rewards, Choice; Social Media\n00:42:24 Tool: \u201cQuiet Time\u201d Protocol, Chronotypes\n00:49:20 Tool: Creativity: Mornings, Movement, Stillness\n00:57:05 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:58:14 Tools: Ideas & Filtering, Feedback & Opinions, Advice\n01:07:15 Tool: Constructive Criticism, \u201cSecond Score\u201d; Verbs\n01:14:40 Tool: Growth Mindsets, Scaffolding; Job Innovation\n01:21:50 Tools: Task Sequencing & Intrinsic Motivation; Tapering & Frame of Reference\n01:30:03 Tools: Momentum, Confidence & Domains; Negative Thought Spirals\n01:36:16 Tool: Phone & \u201cTo Don\u2019t\u201d List; Writing Ideas\n01:39:54 Tool: Bias Blindspot, Reflected Best-Self Portrait\n01:45:36 Helping Others, Synthesizing Information\n01:50:24 Modes of Thinking, Blind Spots & Assumptions\n01:56:10 Thinking Like a Scientist: Hypothesis-Testing & Discourse, Social Media\n02:05:15 Tool: Authenticity, Sincerity & Etiquette, \u201cSnapshot\u201d & Online Presence\n02:12:49 Realizing Potential: Motivation, Opportunity & Process\n02:21:53 Skills to Realize Potential, Perfectionism\n02:27:52 Tool: Early Success & Performance Cycle, \u201cFailure Budget\u201d\n02:31:56 Future Projects, Complex Issues & Challenging Ideas\n02:40:10 Artistic Hobbies, Magicians\n02:45:55 Science Communication, Interest & Self-Relevance\n02:52:16 Languishing, Descriptive Language & Emotions\n03:00:09 Tool: Nurture Potential in Children, \u201cCoach Effect\u201d\n03:10:16 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #AdamGrant #Science\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\n\nIf you're an existing Premium member, you can log in to access the full episode at https://hubermanlab.supercast.com. \n\nIf you're not a member, you can join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium to enjoy exclusive content, including monthly Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and help advance human scientific research.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:01:46 Resveratrol and Longevity Supplements\n00:26:49 Huberman Lab Premium\n\nIn the full AMA episode, we discuss:\n- What Is Working Memory and How to Improve It\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #AMA\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

My favorite part of the evening was the question & answer period, where I had the opportunity to answer questions from the attendees of each event. Included here is the Q&A from our event in Toronto, ON at Meridian Hall. \n\nWe'll be hosting four live events in Australia in February 2024. Limited tickets remain for our show in Melbourne on February 10, 2024, and Brisbane on February 24, 2024. Our show in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House sold out quickly, so we've added a second show at the Aware Super Theatre on February 18, 2024.

I explain how to implement this specific protocol, which takes only four days and 15-30 minutes per day. I also explain the mechanism for how the four-day writing protocol affects neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) and brain function in the short and long term. I explain how these brain changes positively impact our physical health, including our system's immune function and thus our ability to combat infections, improve sleep, reduce feelings of physical and emotional pain, lower anxiety, and bring about healing from traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone seeking better mental and/or physical health through the use of brief yet highly effective science-supported protocols.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nArticles\nConfronting a traumatic event: toward an understanding of inhibition and disease: https://bit.ly/3QMlLD1\nNatural emotion vocabularies as windows on distress and well-being: https://go.nature.com/3QKtYHB\nDisclosure of traumas and immune function: Health implications for psychotherapy: https://bit.ly/3R6y65d\nPutting Feelings Into Words: https://bit.ly/3G4T2nQ\nIncreasing honesty in humans with noninvasive brain stimulation: https://bit.ly/47jAmgh\nThe \u03b21-adrenergic receptor links sympathetic nerves to T\u2009cell exhaustion: https://go.nature.com/3MPKXr5\nWriting About Emotional Experiences as a Therapeutic Process: https://bit.ly/3rOVn2B\nBrain and body are more intertwined than we knew: https://go.nature.com/3MMSXcj\nTherapeutic Journaling: https://bit.ly/3upAImX\n\nBooks\nOpening Up by Writing It Down: How Expressive Writing Improves Health and Eases Emotional Pain: https://amzn.to/47FDnaK\nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzn.to/47HrNMg\n\nOther Resources\nDr. James Pennebaker: https://bit.ly/47CZ7ng \nDr. Paul Conti: Therapy, Treating Trauma & Other Life Challenges (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-paul-conti-therapy-treating-trauma-and-other-life-challenges \nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health \nScience of Social Bonding in Family, Friendship & Romantic Love (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/science-of-social-bonding-in-family-friendship-and-romantic-love \nUsing Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/using-your-nervous-system-to-enhance-your-immune-system \nTools for Managing Stress & Anxiety (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/tools-for-managing-stress-and-anxiety \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Journaling Protocol for Mental & Physical Health\n00:03:06 Sponsors: LMNT, Eight Sleep & Waking Up\n00:07:16 Journaling & Confronting Traumatic Events\n00:11:25 Tool: Expressive Writing\n00:14:38 Morning Notes, Gratitude Journaling, Diary Journaling\n00:18:00 Tool: Consecutive Writing Bouts; Trauma Definition\n00:24:38 Low Expressors vs. High Expressors\n00:29:29 Tools: Language, Vocabulary & Emotion; Analyzing Writing\n00:35:02 Tool: Writing Session Tips\n00:39:31 Sponsor: AG1\n00:41:02 Positive Mental & Physical Benefits\n00:46:45 Expressive Writing & Immune Function; Brain-Body Connection \n00:57:02 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:58:10 Neuroplasticity, Prefrontal Cortex & Subcortical Structures\n01:05:00 Structured Writing, Trauma & Narratives; Truth-Telling\n01:08:56 Neuroplasticity, Truth-Telling & Relief from Trauma\n01:15:32 Honesty, Brain Activity & Narratives\n01:22:01 Overcoming Trauma & the Brain; Stress, Emotions & Honesty\n01:26:41 Expressive Writing Protocol & Benefits\n01:36:16 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Journaling\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

Based on his clinical work and research, he is considered a top world expert on male sexual and reproductive health. We discuss testosterone levels and what really impacts them, testosterone therapy, sperm quality and counts, penile and testicular health and function, pelvic floor and prostate and urinary tract health, erectile function and dysfunction and the various causes and treatments for common male sexual, hormonal and reproductive challenges. We also address post-finasteride syndrome and trends in penile length. This episode is rich in actionable information about men\u2019s sexual and reproductive health, including key tests and at-home evaluations, and the behavioral, nutritional, exercise and prescription-based tools that can support male sexual and reproductive health.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Michael Eisenberg\nClinical profile: https://shc.is/3MwGvNL\nAcademic profile: https://stan.md/3QV7Njz \nPublications: https://stan.md/3QKC1W1\nStanford Male Reproductive Medicine & Surgery Program: https://shc.is/3SAbbBg\nX: https://twitter.com/drmeisenberg\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-eisenberg-9230a429 \n\nArticles\nEvidence for decreasing quality of semen during past 50 years: https://bit.ly/465P8Wm\nTemporal trends in sperm count: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis of samples collected globally in the 20th and 21st centuries: https://bit.ly/3FMzlB9\nGeographic differences in semen quality of fertile U.S. males: https://bit.ly/463SxoF\nSelf-rated health and semen quality among 3,457 young Danish men: https://bit.ly/461q4j6\nEffect of Radiation Emitted by Wireless Devices on Male Reproductive Hormones: A Systematic Review: https://bit.ly/46XON9C\nThe influence of direct mobile phone radiation on sperm quality: https://bit.ly/3tUdG7i\nCannabis and Male Fertility: A Systematic Review: https://bit.ly/46QubQt\nAssociation of paternal age with perinatal outcomes between 2007 and 2016 in the United States: population based cohort study: https://bit.ly/3QiJ4UE\nWorldwide Temporal Trends in Penile Length: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: https://bit.ly/40s7UGi\n\nOther Resources\nTestosterone trends: https://www.urologytimes.com/view/testosterone-levels-show-steady-decrease-among-young-us-men \n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nThe Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen:  https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-how-to-optimize-testosterone-and-estrogen \n\nThe Science of Healthy Hair, Hair Loss and How to Regrow Hair:  https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-healthy-hair-hair-loss-and-how-to-regrow-hair \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Michael Eisenberg\n00:01:49 Sponsors: ROKA & Eight Sleep\n00:04:20 Sperm Quality, Geographic & Environmental Factors \n00:12:00 Fertility & Sperm Quality; Testosterone, Cell Phones & Heat\n00:19:26 Testosterone, Age, Obesity\n00:26:49 Tool: Optimize Sperm Quality, Exogenous Testosterone, hCG\n00:35:26 Sponsor: AG1\n00:36:57 Tool: Lifestyle Factors & Sperm Quality, Alcohol\n00:43:27 Sperm Quality, Recreational & Over-the-Counter Drugs, Cannabis\n00:46:56 High-Impact Sports, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Pituitary & Testosterone\n00:49:55 Bicycling, Numbness & Sexual Dysfunction; Walking & Testosterone\n00:55:39 Exogenous Testosterone Therapy & Cancer\n00:58:39 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:59:57 Sexual & Urinary Health, Nighttime Urination\n01:03:12 Sleep & Semen Quality; Overall Health\n01:09:19 Tool: Sperm Analysis & Overall Health; Sperm Banking\n01:13:21 Paternal Age & Puberty Trends; Older Fathers & Child Health Risk\n01:26:42 Tool: Prostate Health, Urination; Tadalafil (Cialis)\n01:33:02 Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs); Erectile Dysfunction Causes\n01:38:21 Blood Flow & Erectile Dysfunction, Medication; Cardiovascular Health\n01:44:30 Mechanical Erectile Dysfunction Treatments; Peptides; Delayed Ejaculation\n01:52:36 Pelvic Floor Health, Urology & Physical Therapy; Split-Stream Urination\n01:59:03 Penile Length & Trends; Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Puberty\n02:09:01 Hair Loss, Dutasteride, Finasteride & Sexual Health; Post-Finasteride Syndrome\n02:16:11 Clomiphene, Testosterone & Estrogen Signaling\n02:19:31 Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Therapy; Prolactin, Estrogen\n02:24:15 Varicocele; Peyronie\u2019s Disease\n02:27:26 Testis & Cancer Risk; Insurance, Blood Profiles & Semen Analysis\n02:35:03 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MaleFertility\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, I provide science-based tools and protocols to improve mood and mental health. These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the \u201cBig 6\u201d core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being. Then, I explain science-based tools to directly increase confidence, build a stronger concept of self, better understand our unconscious mind, manage stress and improve our emotional tone and processing. I also explain ways to better process negative emotions and traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone wishing to improve their relationship with themselves and others, elevate their mood and mental health, and better contribute to the world in meaningful ways.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nPlunge: https://plunge.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nArticles\nDay and night light exposure are associated with psychiatric disorders: an objective light study in greater than 85,000 people: https://go.nature.com/47aIZcp\nLight exposure during sleep impairs cardiometabolic function: https://bit.ly/47aCNRO\nEffect of self-monitoring through experience sampling on emotion differentiation in depression: https://bit.ly/46QNDMP\nEmotional Granularity Increases With Intensive Ambulatory Assessment: Methodological and Individual Factors Influence How Much: https://bit.ly/4717EAa\nBrief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal: https://bit.ly/3tKojcM\nCardiac vagal control as a marker of emotion regulation in healthy adults: A review: https://bit.ly/46PCQCO\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes & Resources Mentioned\nDr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: How to Understand Emotions: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-lisa-feldman-barrett-how-to-understand-emotions \nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health \nThe Iceberg Model: https://bit.ly/46GNOdH\nGuest Series | Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-assess-improve-all-aspects-of-your-fitness \nFitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/fitness-toolkit-protocol-and-tools-to-optimize-physical-health \nFoundational Fitness Protocol: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/foundational-fitness-protocol \nDr. Layne Norton: The Science of Eating for Health, Fat Loss & Lean Muscle: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-layne-norton-the-science-of-eating-for-health-fat-loss-and-lean-muscle \nDr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health & Performance: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-alia-crum-science-of-mindsets-for-health-performance\n\nOther Resources\nSeasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) lamp: https://amzn.to/3FCgKYk\nDrawing tablet: https://amzn.to/3FzKfdm \nThe Physiological Sigh: https://youtu.be/rBdhqBGqiMc  \nPaul Conti, M.D.: How to heal from trauma and break the cycle of shame (The Drive episode): https://peterattiamd.com/paulconti3\n\"Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It\": https://amzn.to/3GVLHXw \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Mood & Mental Health Toolkit\n00:03:10 Sponsors: Plunge, Eight Sleep & Waking Up\n00:05:35 First Principles of Self-Care & 6 Pillars of Mental Health\n00:13:58 Pillar #1: Sleep & Sleep Routine\n00:18:00 Pillar #2: Light, Sunlight\n00:24:38 Tool: Nighttime Environment & Darkness\n00:28:33 Pillar #3: Movement; Pillar #4: Nutrition\n00:33:18 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:51 Pillar #5: Social Connection\n00:40:00 Pillar #6: Stress Control; Physiological Sigh\n00:45:40 Tool: Raise Stress Threshold, Deliberate Cold Exposure\n00:50:00 6 Pillars & Brain Predictability, Affect & Emotion\n00:57:58 Pharmacology, Psychedelics, Supplements & Neuroplasticity\n01:06:25 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:07:26 Tool: Emotional Granularity\n01:14:39 Tool: Heart Rate Variability & Emotional Graduality; Physiological Sigh\n01:23:49 Tool: Unconscious Mind\n01:26:54 Tool: Self-Concept, Self-Narrative Exercise\n01:34:34 Tool: Unconscious Mind & Dream Analysis; Liminal States\n01:42:52 Tool: Journaling; Generative Drive\n01:52:43 Tool: Processing Trauma\n02:00:43 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #MentalHealth\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., a Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University who is a world expert in the science of emotions. She explains what emotions are and how the brain represents and integrates signals from our body and the environment around us to create our unique emotional states. We discuss the relationship between emotions and language, how our specificity of language impacts our emotional processing, the role of facial expressions in emotions, and how emotions relate to sleep, movement, nutrition and the building and reinforcement of social bonds. We also discuss actionable tools for how to regulate feelings of uncertainty and tools to better understand the emotional states of others. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone curious about the neuroscience and psychology underlying emotions and for those who seek to better understand themselves and relate to others and the world in richer, more adaptive ways.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Emotions\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Lisa Feldman Barrett\nWebsite: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com \nAcademic Profile: https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/lisa-barrett \n\"How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain\": https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/how-emotions-are-made\n\"Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain\": https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain \nTED Talk: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/2018/01/13/ted-talk-you-arent-at-the-mercy-of-your-emotions-your-brain-creates-them \nX: https://twitter.com/lfeldmanbarrett \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@professor.lisa \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-feldman-barrett\n\nArticles\nEmotional Expressions Reconsidered: Challenges to Inferring Emotion From Human Facial Movements: https://bit.ly/46R3XNq\n\nBooks\n\"Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution\": https://amzn.to/3QirDEZ\n\"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma\": https://amzn.to/3rUQyVO\n\"An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us\": https://bit.ly/3QhMFU9\n\"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life\": https://amzn.to/3M2CY9B\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/karl-deisseroth-understanding-and-healing-the-mind\nCounterintuitive Ideas About How the Brain Work (Lex Fridman Podcast): https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett\nLove, Evolution, and the Human Brain (Lex Fridman Podcast):: https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett-2\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett\n00:03:01 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & Levels \n00:05:46 Core Components of Emotions\n00:10:42 Facial Movement & Interpretation, Emotion\n00:19:33 Facial Expressions & Emotion, Individualization\n00:31:03 Emotion Categories, Culture & Child Development\n00:36:53 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:50 Legal System, \u2018Universal\u2019 Emotions & Caution\n00:41:07 Language Descriptions, Differences & Emotion\n00:48:18 Questions & Assumptions; Language, Emotions & Nervous System\n00:53:40 Brain, Uncertainty & Categories\n01:02:51 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:57 Brain & Summaries; Emotions as \u201cMultimodal Summaries\u201d \n01:14:45 Emotional Granularity, Library Analogy \n01:19:40 Brain & Compression, Planning \n01:29:04 Labels & Generalization\n01:34:29 Movement, Sensation, Prediction & Learning\n01:42:44 Feelings of Discomfort & Action\n01:50:32 Tool: Feelings of Uncertainty, Emotion, \u201cAffect\u201d\n02:01:18 Tool: Experience Dimensions & Attention; Individualization\n02:08:36 Affect, Allostasis & Body Budget Analogy\n02:15:41 Depression, \u201cEmotional Flu\u201d\n02:20:20 Tool: Positively Shift Affect; Alcohol & Drugs; SSRIs\n02:27:40 Relationships: Savings or Taxes, Kindness\n02:36:50 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We discuss female hormones, nutrition, supplementation, reproductive health, and fertility, including how the timing and duration of puberty impact a woman\u2019s long-term hormone cycles and menopause. We also discuss the pros and cons of various birth control methods and how hormonal vs. non-hormonal birth control each affects fertility. We cover the factors that impact egg and sperm quality and how to leverage timing for conception. We also discuss procedures to assess female fertility, including egg count and hormone testing, the process of egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive options. This episode represents fairly comprehensive coverage of female hormones and reproductive health, highlighting important tests and screening, behavioral, nutritional, supplement and prescription-based tools that women of any age can use to improve their fertility, hormone function and overall health. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Natalie Crawford\nAs a Woman podcast: https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com/podcast \nWebsite: https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com \nFora Fertility clinical practice: https://www.forafertility.com \nPinnacle: https://pinnacle-conference.com \nCourses: https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com/courses \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nataliecrawfordmd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/NatalieCrawfordMD  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nataliecrawfordmd \nX: https://twitter.com/ncrawfordmd \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@nataliecrawfordmd \nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/nataliecrawfordmd\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-crawford-md-8a56021a0\n\nArticles\nOral contraceptive use in women changes preferences for male facial masculinity and is associated with partner facial masculinity: https://bit.ly/40Ecami\nIntake of protein-rich foods in relation to outcomes of infertility treatment with assisted reproductive technologies: https://bit.ly/47bjKXK\n\nOther Resources\nINVOcell Same-Sex Couple: https://bit.ly/479R4P4\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Natalie Crawford\n00:01:40 Sponsors: Maui Nui Venison & Helix Sleep; The Brain Body Contract\n00:04:59 Female Puberty & Growth Characteristics, Height\n00:13:27 Eggs & Ovulation, Harvesting Eggs, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)\n00:17:31 Endocrine Disruptors, Fetal Development\n00:21:39 Lavender, Tea Tree & Evening Primrose Oils, Scents, Diapers\n00:25:13 Breast Milk vs. Formula & Fertility\n00:26:04 Menstruation Cycle & Hormones, Timing\n00:34:08 Sponsor: AG1\n00:35:59 Estrogen, Progesterone & Menstrual Cycle\n00:38:08 Hormonal Birth Control & Ovarian Reserve, AMH Testing, Fertility\n00:42:42 Spermatogenesis & Testosterone; Heat: Ovaries vs Testes\n00:46:11 Period & Pregnancy, Conception Window\n00:48:56 Estrogen, Libido & Ovulation; Mittelschmerz\n00:51:33 Tool: Intercourse Timing & Conception; Artificial Insemination, IVF\n00:55:03 Egg/Sperm Quality, Cigarettes, Vaping, Cannabis & Alcohol \n01:02:20 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:29 Intrauterine Device (IUD), Depo-Provera & Fertility\n01:10:00 Birth Control Risks & Benefits, Cancers, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)\n01:19:39 Blood Clotting & Birth Control Pill; Health Screening \n01:24:50 Tool: AMH Testing, Ovarian Reserve, Antral Follicle Count Ultrasound\n01:29:55 IVF, In Vitro Maturation (IVM); Early Ovarian Reserve Screening\n01:35:40 Tools: Egg Freezing, IVF; Age & Egg Quality\n01:43:37 Egg Freezing & IVF Procedures, Maternal Age, Success Rates\n01:51:30 Tool: Sperm Freezing & Paternal Age, Vasectomy\n01:55:01 Hormones, Egg Freezing & IVF\n02:00:42 Three-Parent IVF, Mitochondrial DNA\n02:05:21 IVF Embryo Storage & Donation; Donor Education & Consent\n02:14:29 Autism, Developmental Disorders, IVF Babies, Age \n02:20:36 Tools: Sleep, Nutrition & Fertility; Dietary Fat\n02:27:32 Protein, Meat, Tofu, Fish; Sugar, Artificial Sweeteners; Weight & Miscarriage\n02:37:38 Tools: Supplements; Prenatal Vitamins, Omega 3s, Vitamin D, Coenzyme Q10\n02:42:26 L-Carnitine & Male Fertility; PCOS & Myo-inositol; Metformin\n02:47:11 Egg Retrieval, Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome, Minimal Stimulation\n02:57:56 INVOcell\n03:03:12 Egg Freezing, Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), Sperm Fragmentation\n03:11:45 Genetic Testing, IVF Transfer & Success Rate, Embryo Banking\n03:15:10 Menopause\n03:19:47 Hormone Replacement Therapy & Menopause\n03:22:25 Early-signs of Menopause\n03:25:18 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #HormoneHealth #Fertility\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss neuroscience and psychology studies that address the basis of willpower and tenacity, how they differ from motivation and how we can all increase our levels of willpower and tenacity. I discuss whether willpower is a limited resource, the controversial \u201cego depletion\u201d theory of willpower and the role that beliefs play in determining our tenacity and willpower. Then I discuss the neural basis of willpower in the brain and body and how tenacity and willpower relate to sleep, stress, focus and possibly to lifespan. Then, I provide a series of science-supported tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Willpower\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nEgo depletion: Is the active self a limited resource?: https://bit.ly/3LTqnVY\nSelf-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor: https://bit.ly/46Gs15n\nBeliefs about willpower determine the impact of glucose on self-control: https://bit.ly/3Fa9Au6\nThe tenacious brain: How the anterior mid-cingulate contributes to achieving goals: https://bit.ly/48LnGzJ\nThe Will to Persevere Induced by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Cingulate Gyrus: https://bit.ly/3tift5M\nAerobic Exercise Training Increases Brain Volume in Aging Humans: https://bit.ly/45nmM9F\nStress relief as a natural resilience mechanism against depression-like behaviors: https://bit.ly/46AVhuc\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Irrelevant: Neural Mechanisms of Learning Real and Hypothetical Rewards and Effort: https://bit.ly/46mqWA6\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Roy Baumeister: https://roybaumeister.com \nDr. Carol Dweck: https://profiles.stanford.edu/carol-dweck \nDr. Lisa Feldman Barret: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com \nSleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing \nToolkit for Sleep (Huberman Lab Neural Network newsletter): https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/toolkit-for-sleep \nDr. Matthew Walker: The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-matthew-walker-the-science-and-practice-of-perfecting-your-sleep \nHealthy Eating & Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/healthy-eating-and-eating-disorders-anorexia-bulimia-binging \nDr. Robert Sapolsky: Science of Stress, Testosterone & Free Will (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-sapolsky-science-of-stress-testosterone-and-free-will \nFitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/fitness-toolkit-protocol-and-tools-to-optimize-physical-health\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Tenacity & Willpower\n00:01:19 Sponsors: Maui Nui & Helix Sleep\n00:03:49 Tenacity & Willpower vs. Habit Execution; Apathy, Depression & Motivation \n00:10:40 Ego Depletion & Willpower as a Limited Resource; Controversy \n00:19:14 Tool: Autonomic Function, Tenacity & Willpower; Sleep & Stress \n00:28:02 Sponsor: AG1\n00:28:58 Willpower as a Limited Resource (Theory)\n00:35:36 Willpower & Glucose, Brain Energetics\n00:42:44 Beliefs about Willpower & Glucose; Multiple Challenges\n00:52:43 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:54:01 Willpower Brain \u2018Hub\u2019; Anorexia Nervosa, Super-Agers\n01:07:15 Anterior Midcingulate Cortex & Brain/Body Communication \n01:14:54 Allostasis, Anterior Midcingulate Cortex Function\n01:25:19 Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex (aMCC), Difficult Tasks & Neuroplasticity\n01:29:30 Tool: Novel Physical Exercise & Brain; Cognitive Exercise\n01:43:43 Tool: \u201cMicro-sucks\u201d, Increase Tenacity/Willpower\n01:50:58 Impossible Tasks, Super-Agers & Learning, Will to Live\n01:57:23 Tool: Rewards & Improving Tenacity/Willpower\n02:01:07 Tenacity & Willpower Recap\n02:05:55 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

Chris has taught negotiation courses at Harvard and Georgetown Universities and is the author of the book \u201cNever Split the Difference.\u201d We discuss how to navigate difficult conversations of all kinds, including in business, romance and romantic breakups, job firings and tense conversations with family and friends.

    "short_description": "This is episode 4 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Stanford and Harvard-trained psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D. Dr. Conti explains what true self-care is and how our mental health benefits from specific self-care and introspection practices \u2014\u00a0much in the same way that our physical health benefits from certain exercise and nutrition habits. He describes how the foundation of mental health is an understanding of one\u2019s own mind and the specific questions to ask in order to explore the conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves. He describes how this process can be done either on our own, through journaling, meditation and structured thought, or in therapy with the help of a licensed professional. He also explains how unprocessed trauma can short-circuit the process and how to prevent that, and the role of friendships and other relational support systems in the journey of self-exploration for mental health. People of all ages and those with and without self-introspection and therapy experience ought to benefit from the information in this episode.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MentalHealth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzn.to/3GVLHXw\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health (Episode 1): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health (Episode 2): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-improve-your-mental-health\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Build and Maintain Healthy Relationships (Episode 3): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-build-and-maintain-healthy-relationships\nThe Iceberg Model: https://bit.ly/3LDNCn1\nPillars of Mental Health: https://bit.ly/48y0cOo\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Self Care\n00:02:37 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:05:34 What is Self-Care?, Foundation, Self-Understanding\n00:13:18 Life Narratives\n00:15:24 Journaling, Self-Inquiry & Therapy\n00:24:41 Unconscious Mind, Salience & Journaling; Panic Attacks\n00:28:20 Self-Inquiry; Grief & Death\n00:33:23 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:39 Self-Harm, Hopelessness & Therapy\n00:37:27 Apprehension of Unconscious Mind Exploration\n00:42:34 Mental Health Map: Cupboards, Agency & Gratitude, Generative Drive\n00:54:18 Structure of Self, Unconscious Mind, Abscess Analogy\n01:01:57 Exploring the Unconscious Mind, Curiosity, \u201cQuestion the Givens\u201d\n01:10:48 Conscious Mind Exploration; Self Curiosity, Busyness\n01:19:20 Exploring Defense Mechanisms, Character Structure\n01:24:54 Self & Character Structure, \u201cTending the Garden\u201d\n01:32:45 Function of Self Cupboards\n01:35:50 Self-Awareness Exploration, Mirror Meditation\n01:38:34 Defense Mechanisms in Action & Self-Inquiry, Patterns\n01:47:15 Salience Exploration, Grounding Meditation\n01:52:37 Behavior & Self-Reflection; Phantom Driver Analogy\n02:00:14 Self & Strivings; Empowerment & Humility\n02:09:07 Challenges in Certain Life Domains\n02:17:49 Friendships & Support, Social Media\n02:23:50 Anger & Self-Care\n02:34:18 Self-Care & Challenges\n02:38:43 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I describe how your brain and body are fundamentally wired to perceive and respond to music and how those responses can be leveraged to improve your mood, allow for processing sad emotions and enhance learning and performance. I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory. Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Music\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman  \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nTickets: https://hubermanlab.com/tour\nCode: \"Huberman\"\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nEffects of music on the cardiovascular system: https://bit.ly/3Rqkmnn\nMusic versus midazolam during preoperative nerve block placements: a prospective randomized controlled study: https://bit.ly/3RqB5a5\n40-Hz Binaural beats enhance training to mitigate the attentional blink: https://go.nature.com/3LmXWQk\n\nOther Resources\nHow to Increase Motivation & Drive (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-increase-motivation-and-drive\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction\nTools to Manage Dopamine and Improve Motivation & Drive (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/tools-to-manage-dopamine-and-improve-motivation-and-drive/\nBrainwaves (App Store): https://apple.co/3ZBK36N\nBrainwaves (Google Play): https://bit.ly/3enO8HP\nDr. Eddie Chang: The Science of Learning & Speaking Language (Huberman Lab episode) https://hubermanlab.com/dr-eddie-chang-the-science-of-learning-and-speaking-languages\nDr. Erich Jarvis: The Neuroscience of Speech, Language & Music (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/dr-erich-jarvis-the-neuroscience-of-speech-language-and-music \nPhysiological Sigh: https://youtu.be/afAZ1hlvRjI\nMarconi Union \u2013 Weightless: https://youtu.be/qYnA9wWFHLI\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Music & Your Brain\n00:03:32 The Brain Body Contract\n00:04:12 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & ROKA\n00:07:09 Music & Emotions; Brain & Body Interpretation\n00:13:03 Music & Intent; Babies, Music & Movement\n00:19:19 Tool: Health Metrics & Music, Breathing & Heart Rate\n00:29:54 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:50 Music, Brain & Predictions\n00:38:07 Music & Brain: Novelty, Arousal, Memories\n00:44:22 Tool: Movement; Motivation & Faster Music\n00:50:49 Tool: Cognitive Work & Binaural Beats \n00:54:11 Silence or Music for Studying?, White Noise, Binaural Beats\n00:58:47 Tool: Retain Information & Internal Dialogue\n01:00:53 Tool: Focus, Work Breaks & Music\n01:04:11 Physical Exercise, Performance & Music\n01:07:37 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:08:43 Music & Shifting Mood\n01:14:41 \u201cHappy\u201d vs. \u201cSad\u201d Music, \u201cOne-Hit Wonders\u201d & Artificial Intelligence\n01:19:30 \u201cBass Face\u201d; Music, Movement & Facial Expressions\n01:22:46 Tools: Shift to Happy Mood with Music; Sad Mood Catharsis\n01:27:30 Tool: Music & Reducing Anxiety, \u201cWeightless\u201d\n01:31:16 Playing Instruments, Singing & Brain Connectivity\n01:39:58 Music & the Brain \n01:42:14 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We discuss nutrition, food additives, social media and mental health, public health initiatives to combat the crisis of social isolation, the obesity crisis, addiction and other pressing issues in public health. Dr. Murthy explains the role of the U.S. government in promoting specific public health issues and the steps needed to rebuild public trust in scientific and medical information. We also discuss health care accessibility, insurance barriers and individual versus team-based medical care. We also discuss topics gleaned from listener questions, such as the facts and myths about \u201cBig Pharma\u201d and \u201cBig Food\u201d industries, scientific research and public health policies.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #WellBeing\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Vivek Murthy\nHealth & Human Services Profile: https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/vivek-murthy.html \nHouse Calls with Dr. Vivek Murthy podcast: https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/house-calls/index.html \nX (Surgeon General): https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General \nPersonal Website: https://www.vivekmurthy.com \nTogether: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World book: https://www.amazon.com/Together-Connection-Performance-Greater-Happiness/dp/0062913298 \nBetter Together Newsletter: https://www.vivekmurthy.com/blank \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drvivekmurthy/\nX (personal): https://twitter.com/vivek_murthy \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrVivekMurthy\n\nArticles\nHabitual daily intake of a sweet and fatty snack modulates reward processing in humans: https://bit.ly/3ZuLmUK\n\nOther Resources\nOffice of the Surgeon General (OSG): https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/index.html \nU.S. Surgeon General\u2019s Advisory Social Media & Youth Mental Health: https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/youth-mental-health/social-media/index.html \nU.S Surgeon General\u2019s Current Priorities: https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/index.html \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Vivek Murthy\n00:01:53 Sponsors: Maui Nui & ROKA\n00:04:35 Surgeon General Roles\n00:07:44 Illness Framework, Enhancing Wellbeing\n00:12:42 Priorities as Surgeon General\n00:19:50 Public Health Message Distribution\n00:28:24 Diagnosis vs. Optimizing Health\n00:33:04 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:01 Food Additives, Highly Processed Foods, Food Availability\n00:39:11 Difficulties Addressing Health Issues & Highly Processed Foods\n00:49:53 Retribution, Integrity & Public Trust\n00:54:41 Company Opposition\n00:58:32 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:59:50 Public Health Communication, Masks & COVID-19, Public Trust\n01:07:01 Masks, Humility; Building Public Trust\n01:10:45 Rebuilding Relationship to Public, Vaccines\n01:17:41 Community Core & Diversity; Federal Funding\n01:24:55 Big Pharma, \u201cPill for Every Problem\u201d Society \n01:31:48 Interdisciplinary Medical Teams, Individualized & Value-Based Medical Models\n01:38:44 Insurance Barriers, Mental Health Care, Drug Prices\n01:44:40 Isolation Crisis, Social Disconnection, Health Risks \n01:49:15 Community Organizations & Modern Life, Social Media\n01:56:36 Youth & Social Media, Parents, Policy Change\n02:06:45 Real Life vs. Social Media, Kids & Playtime\n02:11:56 Social Media Advice for Parents\n02:20:43 Society & Disconnection, Human Connection & Service\n02:31:20 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

He is the author of the book, \u201cTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic.\u201d Dr. Conti explains how to find, develop and strengthen healthy relationships \u2014 including romantic relationships, work and colleague relationships, and friendships. He explains a roadmap of the conscious and unconscious mind that can allow anyone to navigate conflicts better and set healthy boundaries in relationships. We also discuss common features of unhealthy relationships and clinically supported tools for dealing with relationship insecurity, excessive anxiety, past traumas, manipulation and abuse. Dr. Conti explains how, in healthy relationships, there emerges a dynamic of the mutually generative \u201cus\u201d and how to continually improve that dynamic. The next episode in this special series explores true self-care, which can be cultivated through a process of building self-awareness along with other important practices.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MentalHealth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzn.to/3GVLHXw\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health (Episode 1): https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health (Episode 2): https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-improve-your-mental-health\nThe Iceberg Model: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Iceberg-Model.pdf\nPillars of Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Pillars-of-Mental-Health.pdf\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Build Healthy Relationships\n00:02:04 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:05:01 Healthiest Self in Relationships\n00:10:51 Structure & Function of Self\n00:15:44 Relationships, Levels of Emergence\n00:22:48 Generative Drive in Relationships\n00:35:00 Sponsor: AG1\n00:36:26 Generative Drive, Aggressive Drive, Pleasure Drive\n00:45:16 Romantic Relationships & Matched Generative Drives, Trauma Bonds\n00:53:05 Generative Drive Expression, Libido, Giving & Taking\n01:04:29 Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n01:05:50 Generative Drive in Partnerships\n01:11:16 Libido, Avoidance & Working through Barriers\n01:18:02 Repeating Bad Relationship Patterns, Repetition Compulsion\n01:29:23 Narcissism, Dependence, Attachment Insecurity\n01:34:10 Abusive Relationships, Demoralization\n01:39:37 Oppressors, Darkness, Hope & Change\n01:48:08 Work Relationships, Oppression & Accountability\n01:53:53 Jealousy vs. Envy, Narcissism\n01:59:13 Power Dynamics in Relationships\n02:05:54 Giving vs. Taking in Relationships\n02:09:39 Transactions & Relationships; Family & Generative Drive; Flexibility\n02:19:47 Relationships & Kindergarten\n02:23:04 Anxiety in Relationships, Communication\n02:31:32 The \u201cMagic Bridge of the Us\u201d\n02:37:09 Mentalization, Getting into Another\u2019s Mindset; Navigating Conflict\n02:46:51 Healthy Boundaries\n02:52:08 Self-Awareness, Mentalization\n02:55:28 \u201cBroken Compass\u201d & Self Inquiry, \u201cMap\u201d Analogy\n03:02:25 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Dr. Conti explains specific tools for how to overcome life\u2019s challenges using a framework of self-inquiry that explores all the key elements of self, including defense mechanisms, behaviors, self-awareness and attention. We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful \u201cgenerative drive\u201d of positive, aspirational pursuits. Dr. Conti also explains how to adjust your internal narratives, reduce self-limiting concepts, overcome intrusive thoughts, and how certain defense mechanisms, such as \u201cacting out\u201d or narcissism, show up in ourselves and others. The next episode in this special series explores how to build healthy relationships with others.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MentalHealth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzn.to/3GVLHXw\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nGUEST SERIES | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health\nThe Iceberg Model: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Iceberg-Model.pdf\nPillars of Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Pillars-of-Mental-Health.pdf\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Improve Mental Health\n00:02:19 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up App\n00:05:26 Structure & Function of Healthy Self \n00:16:25 Agency & Gratitude\n00:21:14 Aggressive Drive, Pleasure Drive, Generative Drive\n00:30:00 Physical & Mental Health Similarities, Verb States\n00:37:05 Sponsor: AG1\n00:38:32 Lack of Motivation, Drives\n00:43:06 Video Games/Social Media & Distraction, Generative Drive\n00:51:46 Asking Better Questions, Psychiatric Medicine, Physical Health Parallels\n00:59:10 Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n01:00:30 Self-Reflection & Structure of Self \u201cCupboards\u201d, Trauma & Agency\n01:08:53 Feeling Stuck, Defense Mechanisms & Sublimation, Character\n01:13:58 Self-Reflection & Function of Self \u201cCupboards\u201d, Self-Awareness\n01:19:24 Defense Mechanisms & \u201cActing Out\u201d\n01:26:43 Salience, Intrusive Thoughts\n01:31:24 Self-Reflection, Behaviors & Strivings; Roadmap Forward\n01:38:25 Internal Narratives, Childhood\n01:44:44 Internal Narratives: Self-Scrutiny & Overcoming; Trauma\n01:55:18 Time Required for Change, Understanding Intrusive Thoughts\n02:03:13 Self-Reflection on Internal Drives; Envy\n02:09:56 Generative Drive; Strong Aggressive Drive & Envy\n02:21:50 High Aggressive Drive & Social Relationships, Narcissism\n02:28:43 Narcissism, Destruction, Envy\n02:37:18 Narcissism & Childhood, Change\n02:41:26 Engaging with Narcissists, Disengagement\n02:44:47 Demoralization, Learned Helplessness\n02:49:34 Self-Inventory of Drives, Optimization\n02:56:09 Social Media & Salience, Generative Drive\n03:03:21 Rational Aspiration\n03:13:16 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one's belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose.\n\nOur conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Peter Attia\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nOutlive: The Science & Art of Longevity: https://peterattiamd.com/outlive\nThe Peter Attia Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter \nX (formerly Twitter): https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd \n\nArticles\nReassessing the evidence of a survival advantage in Type 2 diabetes treated with metformin compared with controls without diabetes: a retrospective cohort study: https://bit.ly/3EypTAJ\nThe Hallmarks of Aging: https://bit.ly/3ZeqnFI\nCan people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without?

    "short_description": "This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group. Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors \u2014 either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional. The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MentalHealth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzn.to/41gxm1L\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nDr. Paul Conti: Therapy, Treating Trauma & Other Life Challenges (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/dr-paul-conti-therapy-treating-trauma-and-other-life-challenges\nThe Iceberg Model: https://bit.ly/3Pr13sC\nPillars of Mental Health: https://bit.ly/3r11yjM\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Paul Conti\n00:03:46 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:06:55 What is a Healthy Self?\n00:10:41 Agency & Gratitude; Empowerment & Humility \n00:16:13 Physical Health & Mental Health Parallels\n00:20:21 Structure of Self; Unconscious vs. Conscious Mind; \u201cIceberg\u201d\n00:26:15 Defense Mechanisms; Character Structure \u201cNest\u201d, Sense of Self \n00:31:27 Predispositions & Character Structure\n00:36:01 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:27 Character Structure & Action States; Physical Health Parallels\n00:46:20 Anxiety; Understanding Excessive Anxiety\n00:53:12 Improving Confidence: State Dependence & Phenomenology; Narcissism\n00:59:44 Changing Beliefs & Internal Narratives\n01:06:04 Individuality & Addressing Mental Health Challenges\n01:11:21 Mental Health Goals & Growth\n01:17:32 Function of Self\n01:23:00 Defense Mechanisms: Projection, Displacement\n01:30:14 Projection, Displacement, Projective Identification\n01:34:50 Humor, Sarcasm, Cynicism\n01:40:41 Attention & Salience; Negative Internal Dialogue \n01:45:02 Repetition Compulsion & Defense Mechanism, Trauma\n01:58:55 Mirror Meditation & Self Awareness; Structure & Function of Self, \u201cCupboards\u201d\n02:04:57 Pillars of the Mind, Agency & Gratitude, Happiness\n02:13:53 Generative Drive, Aggressive & Pleasure Drives\n02:21:33 Peace, Contentment & Delight, Generative Drive; Amplification\n02:24:18 Generative Drive, Amplification & Overcoming\n02:33:00 Over-Thinking, Procrastination, Choices\n02:42:20 Aggressive, Pleasure & Generative Drives, Envy\n02:49:46 Envy, Destruction, Mass Shootings\n02:55:38 Demoralization, Isolation, Low Aggressive Drive\n03:02:50 Demoralization, Affiliate Defense \n03:09:32 Strong Aggressive Drive, Competition, Generative Drive Reframing \n03:20:02 Cultivating a Generative Drive, Spirited Inquiry of the \u201cCupboards\u201d\n03:26:06 Current Mental Health Care & Medications\n03:35:33 Role of Medicine in Exploration\n03:40:41 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one\u2019s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc\u2019s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more \u2014 all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics, and AI regulation. This episode is for those interested in the innovative mind, psychology, human behavior, technology, culture and politics.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #AI\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nMarc Andreessen\nAndreessen Horowitz: https://a16z.com \nMarc Andreessen: https://bit.ly/3sBHapY\nMarc Andreessen Substack: https://bit.ly/44SmQOJ \nPmarca Blog: https://bit.ly/45GvRvh\nX: https://twitter.com/pmarca\n\nArticles\nA Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity.

I explain how to define a priority and reach a specific goal by systematically assessing the challenge level, measurability, milestones, and action states needed to make progress from start to finish. I also explain research-supported tools to improve your performance during cognitive or physical goal work \u2014 including directed visualization, variable reward timing, and optimizing your physical environment. I also dispel common myths about goal setting and achievement. This episode provides a science-supported toolkit of zero-cost strategies for goal-setting, goal-pursuit, and goal-completion that can be applied to any physical or cognitive endeavor.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #GoalSetting\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nCircadian Rhythms in Attention: https://bit.ly/3qSDe3B\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes\nThe Science of Setting & Achieving Goals: https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-setting-and-achieving-goals\nDr. Maya Shankar: How to Shape Your Identity & Goals: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-maya-shankar-how-to-shape-your-identity-and-goals\nDr. Emily Balcetis: Tools for Setting & Achieving Goals: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-emily-balcetis-tools-for-setting-and-achieving-goals\nFocus Toolkit: Tools to Improve Your Focus & Concentration: https://hubermanlab.com/focus-toolkit-tools-to-improve-your-focus-and-concentration\nLeverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort: https://hubermanlab.com/leverage-dopamine-to-overcome-procrastination-and-optimize-effort\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction: https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction\nTime Perception & Entrainment by Dopamine, Serotonin & Hormones: https://hubermanlab.com/time-perception-and-entrainment-by-dopamine-serotonin-and-hormones\n\nHuberman Lab Neural Network Newsletters\nTeach & Learn Better With A \u201cNeuroplasticity Super Protocol\u201d: https://hubermanlab.com/teach-and-learn-better-with-a-neuroplasticity-super-protocol\nTools to Manage Dopamine and Improve Motivation & Drive: https://hubermanlab.com/tools-to-manage-dopamine-and-improve-motivation-and-drive\nFoundational Fitness Protocol: https://hubermanlab.com/foundational-fitness-protocol\n\nOther Resources\nTim Ferriss \u201c30 Life Hacks I know at 30 that I wish I knew at 20\u201d: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv-_QWHMwOJ\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Goal Setting Toolkit\n00:02:09 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & Maui Nui\n00:04:43 Biology of Goal Setting & Pursuit\n00:08:50 Tool 1: Choose a Priority Goal\n00:12:04 Tool 2: Pursue Lofty Goals\n00:17:23 Tool 3: Define Verb Actions, Measurability & Specificity; Writing vs. Typing\n00:24:06 Tool 4: Visual Reminder Myth; \u201cPost-It Fallacy\u201d\n00:26:44 Tool 5: Accountability Myth, \u201cDon\u2019t Tell the World\u201d Rule\n00:31:35 Intrinsic Motivation & Goal Achievement \n00:32:58 Sponsor: AG1\n00:33:54 Tool 6: Measurable Goal; Quarterly Cycle\n00:37:35 Tool 7: Quantifiable Goals; Book Writing\n00:43:34 Tool 8: Visualization of End; Motivation & Negative Thinking\n00:50:38 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:51:44 Tool 9: Visual Target/Finish Line Training & Perceived Effort\n01:05:50 Tool 10: Distance from Phone\n01:08:31 Tool 11: Random, Intermittent Reinforcement; Cognitive Rewards\n01:17:11 Tool 12: \u201cMiddle Problem\u201d; Time Chunking\n01:23:16 Tool 13: Circadian Rhythm & Attention\n01:30:09 Tool 14: Protocol Flexibility, Subjective Feelings\n01:32:13 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media \n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We discuss individual differences between people \u2014 focusing on differences in how people sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity, and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining our physical and cognitive traits. We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health. We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Linden\u2019s terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life. This episode also covers sensual touch, cerebellar function, and epigenetic inheritance and ought to be of interest to all interested in neuroscience, genetics, psychology and human development. \n\nTake our survey and get 2 months of Huberman Lab Premium: https://survey.hubermanlab.com/jfe/form/SV_0qZgwusCn66swWG \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX (formerly Twitter): https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. David Linden\nAcademic Profile: https://bit.ly/3YP6yVm \nPublications: https://bit.ly/3YGzi2u\nDr. Linden\u2019s Books: https://amzn.to/44giqAH\nWebsite: http://davidlinden.org \nX (formerly Twitter): www.twitter.com/david_j_linden  \n\nArticles\nBen Barres (1954\u20132017): https://bit.ly/45E5oyb\nA Neuroscientist Prepares for Death: https://bit.ly/3seVsfT\nCan a Neuroscientist Fight Cancer With Mere Thought?: https://nyti.ms/45jHqs8\n\nBooks\nThe Autobiography of a Transgender Scientist: https://amzn.to/3slCpRl\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Leslie Vosshall: https://bit.ly/3OHcF9l\nDr. Catherine Dulac: https://bit.ly/3OB0w5W \nDr. Rachel Herz: https://bit.ly/44izshH \nDr. Karl Deisseroth: https://stan.md/3P3S3JX \nDr. Gloria Choi: https://bit.ly/3soND7o\nDr. Irving Zucker\u2019s Publications: https://bit.ly/3OKi1k7\nDr. Rena Malik: Improving Sexual & Urological Health in Males and Females: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-rena-improving-sexual-and-urological-health-in-males-and-females \nDr. Oded Rechavi: Genes & the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-oded-rechavi-genes-and-the-inheritance-of-memories-across-generations/\nDr. Eddie Chang: The Science of Learning & Speaking Languages: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-eddie-chang-the-science-of-learning-and-speaking-languages/ \nDr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The Science of Psychedelics for Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-robin-carhart-harris-the-science-of-psychedelics-for-mental-health/ \nDr. Matthew Johnson: Psychedelic Medicine: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-matthew-johnson-psychedelic-medicine\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 David Linden\n00:03:59 Sponsors: ROKA & Levels; Huberman Lab Survey\n00:07:54 Sensory Touch & Genitals, Krause Corpuscles\n00:16:46 Sexual Experiences & Sensation\n00:19:14 Human Individuality & Variation; Senses & Odor Detection\n00:30:25 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:22 Visual Individuality; Heat Tolerance; Early Life Experiences & Variation\n00:40:28 Auditory Variability, Perfect Pitch\n00:42:08 Heritability & Human Individuality: Cognitive & Physical Traits\n00:49:36 Heritability, Environment, Personality; Twin Studies\n01:00:12 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:01:19 Development, Chance; Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance\n01:07:37 Single Generation Epigenetic Inheritance & Stress; Autism\n01:15:52 Sleep Paralysis; Cerebellum, Prediction\n01:23:47 Nature vs. Nature, Experience; Linden Hypothesis\n01:30:37 Mind-Body Interaction; Chemical Signals\n01:39:10 Inflammation & Depression\n01:43:35 Neuroplasticity, Inflammation & Mental Disorders; Microglial Cells, Exercise \n01:52:15 Fads & Science\n01:55:16 Mind-Body Communication; Cancer \n02:03:28 Mind-Body, Mediation, Breathwork\n02:07:30 Atrial Fibrillation, Synovial Sarcoma, Heart \n02:14:22 Gratitude & Anger; Chemotherapy, Curiosity & Time Perception\n02:19:58 Death, Brain & Future Prediction, Religion & Afterlife\n02:24:15 Life Advice; Time Perception & Gratitude\n02:34:35 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain\u2019s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term \u2018K-holes\u2019). This episode should interest anyone interested in ketamine, treatments for depression, neuroplasticity mechanisms, psychiatry and mental health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles \nAntidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients: https://bit.ly/44YTGxY\nAttenuation of antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine by opioid receptor antagonism: https://go.nature.com/3qesrR8\natai Life Sciences Announces Results from Phase 2a Trial of PCN-101 (R-ketamine) for Treatment-Resistant Depression: https://bit.ly/47j6wsC \nComparative effects of (S)-ketamine and racemic (R/S)-ketamine on psychopathology, state of consciousness and neurocognitive performance in healthy volunteers: https://bit.ly/44WMxOR\nKetamine Metabolite (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine Interacts with \u03bc and \u03ba Opioid Receptors: https://bit.ly/44e4SWB\n\nOther Resources\nThe Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder/\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Ketamine\n00:02:29 Sponsors: ROKA & Eight Sleep\n00:05:13 Ketamine & PCP; Clinical & Recreational Use\n00:09:00 Depression & Current Treatments\n00:15:17 Preclinical Models of Depression & Ketamine; \u201cLearned Helplessness\u201d \n00:22:11 Ketamine & Clinical Uses; Depression & Suicidality \n00:28:32 Ketamine & Other Psychiatric Challenges; Relief & Durability \n00:33:24 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:29 NMDA Receptor & Neuroplasticity\n00:41:36 Excitatory & Inhibitory Communication, Seizure, NMDA Receptors & Ketamine\n00:48:26 How Ketamine Functions in Brain; Acute & Long-Term Effects\n00:55:36 Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) & Ketamine Therapy\n01:02:28 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:03:40 Ketamine & Opioid Pathway \n01:10:00 Divergent Mechanisms of Immediate & Long-Term Effects\n01:15:45 Habenula, Pro-Depressive Behaviors & Ketamine Therapy\n01:20:36 Ketamine & Context-Dependent Strategy; Reward Pathway\n01:22:45 Dissociative States\n01:26:04 Doses & Routes of Administration; \u201cK-holes\u201d; Risk & Caution\n01:32:25 Ketamine Forms; R-, S- vs R/S- Ketamine; Micro-Dosing \n01:38:24 Ketamine: Effects & Therapy\n01:40:40 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Rena Malik, M.D., a board-certified urologist and pelvic surgeon, male and female pelvic medicine expert, and public health educator. We discuss the major causes of and treatments for sexual and urologic dysfunction, including how to restore, maintain and enhance pelvic floor function and proper neural and vascular (blood) supply to the genitals. We also discuss what controls and can enhance desire and arousal, how to assess and treat erectile dysfunction, and challenges with vaginal lubrication and/or orgasm.

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Maya Shankar, Ph.D., a cognitive scientist, former senior advisor to the White House and Chair of the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team. She is the creator and host of the podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self, and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity. Dr. Shankar shares her experience of redefining her identity after an early career-ending setback. She also explains numerous science-based strategies to effectively define goals, structure our goal pursuits and maintain consistent motivation.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss how to build and apply a growth mindset \u2014 the practice of self-rewarding and focusing on learning and skill development through effort \u2014 to improve learning and performance. I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating \u201cverbs\u201d (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the \u201cstress-is-enhancing mindset,\u201d and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #GrowthMindset\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPraise for intelligence can undermine children's motivation and performance: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003\nWhy do beliefs about intelligence influence learning success?

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Robert Malenka, MD, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine who has made numerous seminal discoveries of how the brain changes (neuroplasticity) in response to learning and in response to rewarding and reinforcing experiences. We discuss the brain\u2019s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Robert Malenka\nStanford academic profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-malenka\nPublications: https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-malenka?tab=publications \nCurrent clinical trial: https://clinicaltrials.stanford.edu/trials/e/NCT03841682.html \nMapLight: https://maplightrx.com/team/robert-malenka\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-malenka-09b3a016b\n\nArticles\nDistinct neural mechanisms for the prosocial and rewarding properties of MDMA: https://bit.ly/3PNs2ze\nOxytocin receptor is not required for social attachment in prairie voles: https://bit.ly/3XLguOZ\nGating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area: https://bit.ly/3rigeee\nAnterior cingulate inputs to nucleus accumbens control the social transfer of pain and analgesia: https://bit.ly/44z3qP1\nSocial reward requires coordinated activity of nucleus accumbens oxytocin and serotonin: https://go.nature.com/44iOQvl\nSelective filtering of excitatory inputs to nucleus accumbens by dopamine and serotonin: https://bit.ly/44UG8n1\nSerotonin receptor regulation as a potential mechanism for sexually dimorphic oxytocin dysregulation in a model of Autism: https://bit.ly/44DS24e\n5-HT modulation of a medial septal circuit tunes social memory stability: https://go.nature.com/3rjlXk7\n\nOther Resources\nMapLight: https://maplightrx.com \nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nMindMed: https://mindmed.co \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robert Malenka\n00:02:37 Sponsors: ROKA & Levels\n00:05:21 Dopamine & Reward Circuitry\n00:11:31 Reward, Arousal, Memory & Dopamine \n00:17:34 Context, Cues & Dopamine Modification\n00:25:38 Memory & Reward Scaling\n00:30:50 Dopamine, \u201cAddictive Liability\u201d & Route of Administration \n00:39:07 Sponsor: AG1\n00:40:04 Drugs of Abuse & Brain Changes; Addiction & Individual Variability\n00:50:51 Reinforcement vs. Reward, Wanting vs. Liking\n00:57:50 Opioids, Psychostimulants & Dopamine\n01:03:38 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:04:51 Self-Doubt, Confidence & Career\n01:12:40 Autism Spectrum Disorder\n01:19:29 Pro-Social Interaction & Reward; Oxytocin, Serotonin & Dopamine\n01:30:30 Nucleus Accumbens & Behavior Probability\n01:38:28 Reward for Pro-Social Behavior\n01:43:13 Social Media & \u201cAddictive Liability\u201d; Gambling\n01:52:17 Pain, Social Behavior & Empathy\n02:02:19 Empathy Circuitry, Dopamine & Serotonin \n02:10:07 Autism Spectrum Disorder & Social Interactions, Empathy\n02:17:23 MDMA, Serotonin & Dopamine; Addiction & Pro-Social Effects\n02:28:13 Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Behavior, MDMA & Pharmacology\n02:37:18 Serotonin, MDMA & Psychedelics \n02:40:16 Psychedelics: Research & Therapeutic Potential\n02:47:57 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

First, I explain the essential components of a well-rounded fitness program for lifelong health and performance including the minimum requirements for progressive resistance and cardiovascular training. Then, I discuss 12 valuable science-supported fitness tools that take a small amount of time to implement, yet all of which can greatly enhance your level of fitness. These include short endurance-enhancing and strength and hypertrophy-enhancing tools, as well as psychological, respiration (breathing), nutrition and supplementation-based tools \u2014 all of which will improve your fitness in meaningful ways and can be easily layered into existing exercise programs to improve your fitness and performance outcomes.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Fitness\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nHuberman Lab Guest Series with Dr. Andy Galpin\nEpisode 1 \u2013 Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-assess-improve-all-aspects-of-your-fitness\nEpisode 2 \u2013 Dr. Andy Galpin: Optimal Protocols to Build Strength & Grow Muscles: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-and-grow-muscles/\nEpisode 3 \u2013 Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Physical Endurance & Lose Fat: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-physical-endurance-and-lose-fat/ \nEpisode 4 \u2013 Dr. Andy Galpin: Optimize Your Training Program for Fitness & Longevity: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-optimize-your-training-program-for-fitness-and-longevity/ \nEpisode 5 \u2013 Dr. Andy Galpin: Maximize Recovery to Achieve Fitness & Performance Goals: https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-maximize-recovery-to-achieve-fitness-and-performance-goals/ \nEpisode 6 \u2013 Dr. Andy Galpin: Optimal Nutrition & Supplementation for Fitness: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-optimal-nutrition-and-supplementation-for-fitness/ \n\nWatch the full guest series on YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4N_PVVoq0Za03YKASSGCazr\n\nOther Resources\nFitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health: https://hubermanlab.com/fitness-toolkit-protocol-and-tools-to-optimize-physical-health/\nFoundational Fitness Protocol: https://hubermanlab.com/foundational-fitness-protocol/\n\u201c3 x 5\u201d Approach: https://youtu.be/CyDLbrZK75U?t=4373 \n\u201cSugarcane\u201d Protocol: https://youtu.be/oNkDA2F7CjM?t=11505 \nHow to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance: https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-breathe-correctly-for-optimal-health-mood-learning-and-performance/ \nDr. Rhonda Patrick: Micronutrients for Health & Longevity: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-rhonda-patrick-micronutrients-for-health-and-longevity/ \nDr. Layne Norton: The Science of Eating for Health, Fat Loss & Lean Muscle: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-layne-norton-the-science-of-eating-for-health-fat-loss-and-lean-muscle/\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Tools to Improve Fitness\n00:02:36 Sponsors: LMNT & Helix Sleep\n00:05:13 Foundational Fitness Program\n00:13:33 Tool 1: Zone 2 Cardio & Daily Activities \n00:20:33 Tool 2: Low Repetition Strength Training, 3 x 5 Protocol, Warm-Up Sets\n00:33:11 Age-Related Strength Decline\n00:36:53 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:38:08 Tool 3: \u201cSugarcane\u201d Endurance Protocol\n00:43:29 Tool 4: Exercise \u201cSnacks\u201d; Cardiovascular & Muscular Endurance \n00:55:31 Tool 5: Rest Period & Physiological Sighs\n00:01:20 Tool 6: Down-Regulation Breathing & Recovery\n01:04:32 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:05:38 Tool 7: \u201cThe Line\u201d \n01:09:55 Tool 8: Smartphone Use & Training\n01:13:44 Tool 9: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n01:15:37 Tool 10: Creatine \n01:20:08 Tool 11: Rhodiola Rosea\n01:25:13 Tool 12: Training Fasted or Fed, Caffeine\n01:31:09 Training Session Flexibility\n01:33:37 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Jeffrey Goldberg, MD, PhD, professor and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University. His clinical and research efforts focus on retinal and optic nerve diseases such as glaucoma and discovering stem cell and nanotechnology treatments to cure blindness. We discuss how to maintain and improve eye health throughout life, the advantages and disadvantages of corrective lenses, including if you should wear \u201creaders,\u201d the use and risks of contact lenses, considerations for LASIK eye surgery, floaters, dry eye, the importance of sunlight and UV protection and specific exercises to improve eye and vision health. Dr. Goldberg also explains age-related conditions: cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy; and the behavioral and supplementation-based, prescription and surgical tools used to promote eye health. This episode provides essential tools for listeners of any age and background to maintain eye health and offset vision loss.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #EyeHealth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Jeffrey Goldberg\nAcademic Profile: https://stanford.io/3NKhyiP \nLab Website: https://stan.md/3r4fgCf \nPublications: https://stanford.io/3Pvyo6r \nOpen Clinical Trials: https://stanford.io/44cJ5yA \nMedical Profile: https://shc.is/3CLYPwX \nStanford Ophthalmology website: https://stan.md/44fIIn9\nSupport Stanford Ophthalmology research: https://stan.md/3qRDAHh\n\nArticles\nWeeklong improved colour contrasts sensitivity after single 670 nm exposures associated with enhanced mitochondrial function: https://go.nature.com/46jzN5P\nImprovement in inner retinal function in glaucoma with nicotinamide (vitamin B3): supplementation: A crossover randomized clinical trial: https://bit.ly/3peYWOB\nNovel Foveal Features Associated With Vision Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis: https://bit.ly/3pg7rZN\n\nOther Resources\n\u201cPencil Pushups\u201d Near-Far Exercise: https://youtu.be/ObtW353d5i0?t=4130  \nSmooth Pursuit Eye Exercises: https://www.youtube.com/c/VisualExercises/videos \nStanford Vision Performance Center: https://med.stanford.edu/vpc.html \nAREDS2 Supplements for Age-Related Macular Degeneration:  https://bit.ly/3NKIFdC\nClinical Trials Glaucoma & Vitamin B6 Supplementation: https://bit.ly/3r3bGbB\nDr. Dubra Lab: https://dubralab.stanford.edu \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg\n00:03:08 Sponsors: Maui Nui, LMNT, Eight Sleep\n00:06:29 Childhood & Eye Exams\n00:11:36 Eye Misalignment & Recovery\n00:20:38 Myopia (Near-Sightedness), Children & Sunlight\n00:30:04 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:31:18 Eye Safety & Protection; Eye Hygiene \n00:40:07 Adults & Eye Exams; Optometrist vs Ophthalmologist\n00:46:35 Presbyopia (Age-Related Vision Decline), Reading Glasses\n00:54:54 Reading Glasses: Use & Recommendations\n00:58:34 Night Vision & Glasses\n01:02:55 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:54 Corrective Eye Glasses, Exercises\n01:09:52 Near-Far Exercise & Presbyopia; Smooth Pursuit Exercise & Concussion \n01:13:25 Supranormal Vision & Performance Training\n01:19:11 20/20 Vision; Visual Acuity \n01:24:51 Contact Lenses: Use, Risks & Aging\n01:31:34 UV Protection & Cataracts, \u201cBlue Blockers\u201d\n01:38:20 Light Sensitivity & Eye Color\n01:40:29 LASIK Eye Surgery\n01:46:26 Dry Eye, Tears & Age\n01:53:24 Dry Eye, Serum Tears & Preservative-Free Artificial Tears; PRP\n02:00:46 Vision Loss: Cataracts, Glaucoma\n02:09:23 Age-Related Macular Degeneration, Dry & Wet Forms\n02:14:02 Diabetic Retinopathy, Type I vs Type II Diabetes\n02:18:54 Diabetic Retinopathy Treatment, Blood Pressure\n02:22:17 Glaucoma Screening & Treatment\n02:28:07 Smoking, Vaping & Vision Diseases; Cannabis & Eye Pressure\n02:35:13 Eye Pressure & Sleep Position\n02:37:48 Macular Degeneration, Optic Neuropathies & Red-Light Therapy\n02:42:23 \u201cFloaters\u201d \n02:45:29 Eye Twitching\n02:48:10 AREDS2 Supplementation & Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n02:53:39 Glaucoma & Vitamin B3 Supplementation\n02:58:42 Retinal Imaging & Neurodegeneration Screening, Multiple Sclerosis \n03:06:30 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Tim Ferriss \u2014 a five-time #1 New York Times bestselling author, technology investor and host of the iconic podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show. We discuss Tim\u2019s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery \u2014 themes that have spanned his career that have placed him on the cutting-edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery, how to find and work with mentors, the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim\u2019s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners, as Tim\u2019s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts. What distinguishes Tim is his ability to thoughtfully deconstruct these processes in order to teach others how to do the same. \n\n#HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTim Ferriss\nPodcast: https://tim.blog/podcast\nBooks by Tim Ferriss: https://tim.blog/tim-ferriss-books\nBlog: https://tim.blog \nTED talks: https://www.ted.com/speakers/tim_ferriss \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tferriss\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/timferriss\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/timferriss\n\nResources\nPeter Attia \u2018Studying Studies\u2019 series: https://peterattiamd.com/ns001\nPeter Attia episode: https://tim.blog/2023/03/14/peter-attia-outlive \nThe Slow-Carb Diet: https://tim.blog/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds\nHow to Lose 20 lbs. of Fat in 30 Days: https://tim.blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise\nSeth Godin episode: https://tim.blog/2016/02/10/seth-godin \nSuicide article: https://tim.blog/2015/05/06/how-to-commit-suicide\nHealing After Childhood Abuse episode: https://tim.blog/2020/09/16/how-to-heal-trauma-transcript\nDog Training episode: https://tim.blog/2016/11/14/susan-garrett\nSaisei Foundation: https://saiseifoundation.org \nThe Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation (POPLAR): https://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/research/the-project-on-psychedelics-law-and-regulation-poplar \nFerriss-UC Berkeley Psychedelic Journalism Fellowship: https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/bcsp\nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nWaking Up app: https://www.wakingup.com \nCockpunch: https://cockpunch.com \n\nBooks\nBuilt to Move: https://a.co/d/0z5Q6pu\nWhy We Sleep: https://a.co/d/2Ff5QHH\nThe Art of Fiction: https://a.co/d/1SCNIzl\nBad Science: https://a.co/d/iv5SM24\nHow to Lie with Statistics: https://a.co/d/dhbEsUp\nBrain Energy: https://a.co/d/bt8hTLU\nGold: https://a.co/d/1sWaF1i\nDon't Shoot the Dog: https://a.co/d/d5zOjgH\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Tim Ferriss\n00:04:08 Sponsors: Maui Nui, LMNT, Levels\n00:07:43 4-Hour Body & Development Mindset\n00:15:22 Origins of Good Ideas \n00:20:06 Writing & Structured Thinking\n00:27:58 Writing, Night Owls\n00:33:06 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:21 Investigating Outliers; Social Media & Smartphones\n00:40:37 Scientific Literacy, Randomized Clinical Trials \n00:45:09 Supplement & Experiment Fails; Cold Exposure & Hyperthermia\n00:50:46 Slow Carb Diet & Adherence\n01:03:35 Morning Protein Intake; Fasting\n01:08:48 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:09:53 Power of Place; Building Your Network & Volunteering\n01:21:43 Developing Skills; Examining Motivation & Good Questions; Simplicity\n01:33:32 Early Psychedelic Exploration, Depression\n01:45:38 Psychedelic Research & Mental Health Funding\n01:59:00 Saisei Foundation, Journalism Fellowship, Law & Education\n02:08:22 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Psychedelics\n02:13:28 Meditation, Transcendental Meditation, Nature \n02:18:50 Extended Nature Retreats & Integration Period; \u201cGenerative Drive\u201d\n02:28:05 Mentors\n02:34:53 Mind & Attention Allocation, Social Media, Boredom\n02:44:12 Cockpunch\n03:00:23 Suicide & Depression, Sexual Abuse, Vulnerability \n03:14:22 Making Meaning from Suffering\n03:19:32 Role Identity, Future\n03:27:38 Parenthood, Animals & Training\n03:32:21 Podcasting, Experimentation\n03:36:52 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which is also commonly known as \u201cecstasy\u201d or \u201cmolly,\u201d including how it works in the brain to cause short- and long- term-shifts in emotional processing and its clinical applications for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol and other substance-use addictions. I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces \u201cthreat detection\u201d and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA \u201ccrash,\u201d the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA. This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTDS, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nA Conserved Role for Serotonergic Neurotransmission in Mediating Social Behavior in Octopus: https://bit.ly/3oV8zSl\nEffects of MDMA on sociability and neural response to social threat and social reward: https://bit.ly/3NlOYUC\nThe Effects of Acutely Administered 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine on Spontaneous Brain Function in Healthy Volunteers Measured with Arterial Spin Labeling and Blood Oxygen Level\u2013Dependent Resting State Functional Connectivity: https://bit.ly/42yMEhl\nDistinct neural mechanisms for the prosocial and rewarding properties of MDMA: https://bit.ly/3NlNERM\nPlasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans: https://bit.ly/42AF6e0\nRETRACTED: Severe Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity in Primates After a Common Recreational Dose Regimen of MDMA (\"Ecstasy\"): https://bit.ly/3J9PTVU\nScience forced to retract article on \u201cecstasy\u201d: https://bit.ly/3oRRpVM\nResidual neurocognitive features of long-term ecstasy users with minimal exposure to other drugs: https://bit.ly/3P93gcM\nMDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study: https://go.nature.com/3WqI2Zd\nThe effects of MDMA-assisted therapy on alcohol and substance use in a phase 3 trial for treatment of severe PTSD: https://bit.ly/42wqeNP\n\nBooks\nPIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story: https://amzn.to/45ZY80w\nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: https://amzn.to/45VdgfA\nThe Body Keeps the Score: https://amzn.to/3XgH5Dz\n\nOther Resources\nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nParticipate in a MAPS trial: https://maps.org/take-action/participate-in-trial\nHuberman Lab episode on psilocybin: https://bit.ly/43yP80G\nHuberman Lab episode on psychedelics for mental health: https://bit.ly/3NqC3Rz \nHuberman Lab episode on dopamine, mindset & drive: https://bit.ly/3IqQzVb\nHuberman Lab episode on leveraging dopamine: https://bit.ly/3P3dCuD\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 MDMA \u201cEcstasy\u201d\n00:04:37 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, ROKA, HVMN\n00:08:18 MDMA History & Synthesis; Legality \n00:14:45 MDMA, Methamphetamine (Meth), Dopamine & Serotonin\n00:23:30 MDMA vs Psychedelics vs Ketamine\n00:26:54 MDMA & Serotonin 1B Receptor, Subjective Feelings, Trauma \n00:33:36 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:51 Amygdala & Threat Detection, Pro-Social Behavior, MDMA Dosages\n00:45:48 Interoception, MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n00:52:36 Long-Term Effects, Threat Detection & PTSD\n00:56:14 MDMA, Social Connection & Empathy; Meth, SSRIs \n01:06:10 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:07:22 Oxytocin & MDMA\n01:16:10 Safety & Neurotoxicity; Recreational Use, Caffeine & Fentanyl\n01:26:36 Is MDMA Neurotoxic?; Poly-Pharmacology, Body Temperature\n01:37:07 Post-MDMA \u201cCrash\u201d, Prolactin & P 5 P\n01:43:07 PTSD & Trauma; Talk Therapy, SSRIs\n01:54:09 PTSD Treatment: Talk Therapy + MDMA\n02:02:46 MDMA & Addiction; Dissociative PTSD & Empathy\n02:09:47 Side-Effects?, MDMA Efficacy & Legality\n02:15:22 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, I explain how medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse and other stimulants work to increase focus and treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use. This episode ought to benefit anyone with ADHD, their parents, those on ADHD medications or anyone curious about how these medications work.\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nCardiovascular Effects of ADHD Therapies: JACC Review Topic of the Week: https://bit.ly/3MDbiri\nBrain alterations in children/adolescents with ADHD revisited: A neuroimaging meta-analysis of 96 structural and functional studies: https://bit.ly/3WDs0ve\nImpulsivity, Compulsivity, and Top-Down Cognitive Control: https://bit.ly/3MM3uUq\nDopaminergic System Dysfunction in Recreational Dexamphetamine Users: https://go.nature.com/3WDM9Bk\nModafinil enhances alerting-related brain activity in attention networks: https://bit.ly/3WLwobF\nAssociation of Intrinsic Brain Architecture With Changes in Attentional and Mood Symptoms During Development: https://bit.ly/3qhaaCl\nCognitive enhancement effects of stimulants: a randomized controlled trial testing methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine: https://bit.ly/4270EPr\nPsychostimulants and Cognition: A Continuum of Behavioral and Cognitive Activation: https://bit.ly/3MHqAv6\nNeural Correlates of Symptom Improvement Following Stimulant Treatment in Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: https://bit.ly/3ILu2DI\nLong-term effects of stimulant exposure on cerebral blood flow response to methylphenidate and behavior in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: https://bit.ly/45CQpFu\nMolecular Characterisation of the Mechanism of Action of Stimulant Drugs Lisdexamfetamine and Methylphenidate on ADHD Neurobiology: A Review: https://bit.ly/45Bsl5J\nPharmacologic treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis: https://bit.ly/3J8rEaH\n\nBooks\nStahl's Essential Psychopharmacology (4th Edition): https://a.co/d/fJZekoD\n\nOther Resources\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction: https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU\nLeverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort: https://youtu.be/K-TW2Chpz4k\nADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus: https://youtu.be/hFL6qRIJZ_Y\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Stimulants & Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \n00:03:21 Sponsors: Maui Nui, ROKA, HVMN \n00:06:35 The Brain-Body Contract\n00:07:22 Attention, Prefrontal Cortex & ADHD\n00:16:27 Stimulants \u201cSympathomimetics\u201d \n00:21:29 Adderall, Dopamine & Norepinephrine\n00:25:58 Sympathomimetics, Dopamine & Norepinephrine\n00:31:05 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:20 Vyvanse is Timed-Release D-Amp\n00:36:36 Ritalin, Concerta \n00:40:10 Dopamine & \u201cNoise Reduction\u201d; Norepinephrine & \u201cSignal Amplification\u201d\n00:45:28 ADHD: Focus, Hyperactivity & Impulsivity; Drug Selection & Dose\n00:50:57 How do Stimulants \u2018Calm\u2019 ADHD?\n00:54:48 Neuroplasticity & Neuromodulators\n00:58:06 Kids, ADHD Diagnosis & Treatment; Predispose Addiction?\n01:04:02 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:05:12 ADHD Medications: Individuality, Doses, Tapering & Long-Term Use\n01:13:28 Medication & Long-Term Effects: Height, Cardiovascular Risk, Alcohol \n01:19:32 Cortisol & Hormones \n01:27:45 Psychosis & Addiction; Methamphetamine \n01:38:20 Recreational Use, Addiction & Psychosis; Habituation\n01:42:30 Drug Holidays; Ritalin & Long-Term Effects\n01:45:35 Modafinil, Armodafinil; Side-Effects\n01:53:03 Guanfacine, Alcohol \n01:58:03 ADHD Medications\n02:00:26 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Robin Carhart-Harris, PhD, distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to \u201cgo internal,\u201d and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks. As such, this episode ought to be of use to anyone interested in brain plasticity, mental health, psychology or neuroscience.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Robin Carhart-Harris\nAcademic Profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robin.carhart-harris \nPublications: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robin.carhart-harris#toc-id3 \nSupport USCF Psychedelic Research Fund: https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_GeneralGivingForm&Other=Psychedelic%20Research%20Fund%20zzz%207031398-SFFDN\nUCSF Clinical Trials Enrollment: https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/psychedelic-experiences \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RCarhartHarris \nTEDx Talk: https://youtu.be/MZIaTaNR3gk\n\nArticles\nSelf-blinding citizen science to explore psychedelic microdosing: https://bit.ly/3IxMrUJ\nTrial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression: https://bit.ly/3Os2I11\nPivotal mental states: https://bit.ly/3ITFVYH\nIncreased global integration in the brain after psilocybin therapy for depression: https://go.nature.com/3q4Sb1z\nStructure-based discovery of nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analogs: https://bit.ly/41Svyux\nSelf-Medication for Chronic Pain Using Classic Psychedelics: A Qualitative Investigation to Inform Future Research: https://bit.ly/3Wr1q8C\nMDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study: https://go.nature.com/3WqI2Zd\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris\n00:02:12 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels, HVMN \n00:05:41 The Brain-Body Contract\n00:06:31 Origin of the Word: \u201cPsychedelics\u201d; Pharmacology \n00:12:05 Psychedelics & Revealing the Unconscious Mind, Psychotherapy \n00:17:32 Microdosing\n00:26:08 Psilocybin vs. Magic Mushroom Doses\n00:28:28 \u201cPsychedelic-Therapy\u201d, Music \n00:35:12 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:26 Psychedelic Journey: \u201cTrust, Let Go, Be Open\u201d \n00:43:01 Negative Emotions, Fear & Psychedelics\n00:46:21 Global Functional Connectivity, Serotonin 2A Receptor; Subjective Experiences\n00:52:33 Pharmacology: Therapeutics without Psychedelic Effects; SSRIs\n00:58:45 Psilocybin & Depression; Long-Term Effects: Connectivity & Neuroplasticity \n01:09:14 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:10:26 Psilocybin Therapy & Anorexia\n01:12:56 Integration Phase & Psychedelic-Therapy; Meditation\n01:19:50 First-Time Psychedelic Use, \u201cEntropic Brain Effect\u201d, Neuroplasticity, Cognition\n01:30:16 Fibromyalgia & Psychedelic Treatment; MDMA Therapy & \u201cInner Healer\u201d\n01:38:55 Placebo Response & Psychedelic Therapy \n01:41:39 LSD & Psychedelic-Therapy, Micro-Dose\n01:48:19 Combination Psilocybin-MDMA Therapy\n01:56:06 DMT \u201cRocketship\u201d & Serotonin 2A Receptors; Ibogaine\n02:01:04 \u201cEgo Dissolution\u201d, Cocaine vs. Psychedelics; Relapses\n02:12:26 Psychedelics & Legal Landscape; Decriminalization\n02:17:54 MDMA, Trauma & Clinical Trials; Future Regulatory (FDA) Approval?\n02:23:25 Psilocybin & Current Clinical Trials \n02:28:41 Mental Health & Psychedelic Treatment, Safeguards, Paradigm Shift\n02:34:39 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss what psilocybin is (chemically) and how it works at the cellular and neural circuit level to trigger neuroplasticity, which is our brain\u2019s ability to rewire itself in ways that lead to long-lasting shifts in our emotional, cognitive and behavioral patterns and abilities. I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin. This episode is a thorough exploration of psilocybin from the scientific and clinical literature perspective and ought to be of interest to anyone curious about psilocybin, mental health, neuroplasticity and/or psychedelics more generally.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com code: \u201cHuberman\u201d\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nThe neural basis of psychedelic action: https://go.nature.com/3VInMlE\nThe effects of psilocybin and MDMA on between-network resting state functional connectivity in healthy volunteers: https://bit.ly/3VW8iL7\nIncreased low-frequency brain responses to music after psilocybin therapy for depression: https://bit.ly/3LKj6XK\nQuality of Acute Psychedelic Experience Predicts Therapeutic Efficacy of Psilocybin for Treatment-Resistant Depression: https://bit.ly/42c7y6x\nBrief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal: https://bit.ly/3wEvGRf\nTherapeutic use of psilocybin: Practical considerations for dosing and administration: https://bit.ly/3HPHLZM\nPsilocybin induces rapid and persistent growth of dendritic spines in frontal cortex in vivo: https://bit.ly/3HQ8J3z\nPsychedelics and Neuroplasticity: A Systematic Review Unraveling the Biological Underpinnings of Psychedelics: https://bit.ly/44Gpwjx\nSingle-Dose Psilocybin for a Treatment-Resistant Episode of Major Depression: https://bit.ly/3pjvu9N\nEffects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: https://bit.ly/3sFSGMM\nThe costs and benefits of psychedelics on cognition and mood: https://bit.ly/3NNyEwI\n\nOther Resources\nThe Physiological Sigh: https://youtu.be/rBdhqBGqiMc\nDr. Matthew Johnson: Psychedelic Medicine: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-matthew-johnson-psychedelic-medicine\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Psilocybin, Legal Considerations\n00:08:32 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, ROKA, HVMN \n00:12:00 Psilocybin Becomes Psilocin in the Gut, Serotonin \n00:17:00 The Serotonin 2A Receptor, Therapeutic Outcomes SSRIs vs. Psilocybin\n00:21:40 Serotonin Receptor Expression; Visual Hallucinations & Eyes Closed\n00:27:21 Safety & Cautions for Specific Patient Populations\n00:29:13 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:30:28 Psilocybin, \u201cMagic Mushrooms\u201d Dosing, Micro-Dosing, \u201cHeroic Doses\u201d\n00:36:21 Psychedelic Journey: Set, Setting & Support\n00:43:43 Music & the Psilocybin Journey; Duration of Effects\n00:48:58 Psilocybin & the Brain: Subjective Experiences, Perception\n00:58:36 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:59:48 Brain Networks & Therapeutic Outcomes\n01:05:23 Creativity; Music, Emotionality & Psychedelic Journeys\n01:12:39 Depression & Psychedelics as Neuroplasticity \u201cWedge\u201d\n01:16:53 Positive Psychedelic Journeys, Unity, \u201cOceanic Boundlessness\u201d\n01:25:23 \u201cBad Trips\u201d, Anxiety & Physiological Sighs\n01:32:57 Therapeutic Use of Psilocybin\n01:36:11 Neuroplasticity, Structural Brain Changes & Psilocybin\n01:48:08 Psychedelics: Therapeutic Breakthroughs & Depression \n01:56:37 Combining Psilocybin Therapy & Talk Therapy, Antidepressant Effects\n02:03:11 Psilocybin Experience & Mental Health\n02:06:42 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

She earned her doctoral degree at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, researching the effects of deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure on metabolism and other aspects of human physiology. We discuss how cold or sauna can improve metabolism, cardiovascular and brain health, balance hormones, and decrease inflammation. Dr. S\u00f8berg discusses how deliberate cold protocols can improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and trigger release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine which enhance energy, mood, and focus. We compare cold showers and cold immersion, traditional and infrared saunas, and other variables. This episode provides actionable tools and answers to common questions about the use of deliberate cold and heat to improve health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nPlunge: https://plunge.com/huberman \nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nTickets: https://hubermanlab.com/tour\nPresale code: HUBERMAN\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Susanna S\u00f8berg\nWinter Swimming: The Nordic Way Towards a Healthier and Happier Life: https://amzn.to/3MsyxW0\nThe Soeberg Institute: https://www.soeberginstitute.com \nPublications: https://www.soeberginstitute.com/research \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SusannaSberg1 \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/susannasoeberg\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@susannasoeberg \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@susanna_soeberg \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/susanna_soeberg\n\nArticles\nAltered brown fat thermoregulation and enhanced cold-induced thermogenesis in young, healthy, winter-swimming men: https://bit.ly/3MqCNWb\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3IumXX1\nVariations in leptin and insulin levels within one swimming season in non-obese female cold water swimmers: https://bit.ly/3MpX0eF\nMapping of human brown adipose tissue in lean and obese young men: https://bit.ly/3pEd6Zg\nA role for brown adipose tissue in diet-induced thermogenesis: https://go.nature.com/3Ob03ZI\nAssociation Between Sauna Bathing and Fatal Cardiovascular and All-Cause Mortality Events: https://bit.ly/33P09RC\nImpact of cold exposure on life satisfaction and physical composition of soldiers: https://bit.ly/3kMxG7G\nThermal effects of whole head submersion in cold water on nonshivering humans: https://bit.ly/3I8JA4l\nThermoregulation during rest and exercise in the cold in pre- and early pubescent boys and in young men: https://bit.ly/3Ia1fsg\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Susanna S\u00f8berg\n00:03:23 Sponsors: Plunge, Maui Nui, Thesis \n00:06:49 The Brain-Body Contract\n00:07:40 Physiology in Uncomfortably Cold Environments\n00:12:05 Tool: Water Temperature, \u201cCold Shock\u201d & Discomfort\n00:17:37 Cold Showers vs. Immersion in Water, Brown Fat\n00:22:11 Cold Receptors, Brown Fat & Temperature Homeostasis\n00:25:22 Shiver, \u201cAfter Drop\u201d, Healthy Stress\n00:31:08 Long-Term Health Benefits of Deliberate Cold Exposure\n00:35:48 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:37:02 Blood Pressure & Heath\n00:38:26 Brown Fat, Insulin Sensitivity & Metabolism\n00:45:07 Temperature Regulation, Brown Fat vs. White Fat\n00:52:26 Cold Resilience, Scandinavia \n00:59:07 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:00:16 Winter Swimmers & Brown Fat; Discomfort\n01:10:28 Sex differences & Brown Fat, Cold-Adapted\n01:15:21 Diving Reflex & Parasympathetic Activation \n01:18:44 Tool: Deliberate Cold & Sauna Protocol\n01:23:11 Winter Swimmers, Shiver; Circadian Rhythm & Brown Fat\n01:31:14 Tool: Minimum Threshold for Cold & Heat; Sauna & Cardiovascular Health\n01:35:19 Tool: Maintaining Stimulus when Cold-Adapted; Shorter Sessions\n01:38:09 Cold Exposure, Sleep Quality, Clothing\n01:47:37 \u201cBrown Fat Negative\u201d & Shiver\n01:52:13 Cold & Heat, Inflammation Reduction\n01:55:40 Tool: \u201cSoberg Principle\u201d: End on Cold, Metabolism\n01:59:39 Cold Exposure: Fed or Fasted?\n02:00:32 Raynaud\u2019s Syndrome; Hand/Feet Protection in Cold\n02:05:21 Tool: Headache & Cold Exposure; Head Submersion & Head Coverings\n02:11:29 Children & Hypothermia Risk \n02:17:16 Gender Differences & Cold Exposure\n02:19:57 Tool: Brief, Repeated Temperature Changes; Circadian Rhythm & Temperature\n02:27:53 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Matthew MacDougall, MD, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink\u2019s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink\u2019s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink\u2019s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Matthew MacDougall\nClinical Practice: https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-matthew-macdougall \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmmacdougall\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/matthewmacdoug4 \nThe Institute: https://www.theinstitute.com/fellow/matthew-macdougall \n\nNeuralink\nNeuralink: https://neuralink.com \nNeuralink\u2019s Patient Registry: https://neuralink.com/patient-registry\nJoin Neuralink: https://neuralink.com/careers\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Matthew MacDougall\n00:04:05 Sponsors: HVMN, Levels, Thesis\n00:07:38 Brain Function & Injury; Brain Tumor Treatment\n00:13:52 Frontal Lobe Filter; Sleep Deprivation\n00:19:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology & Machines\n00:22:10 Neuralink, Neural Implants & Injury, Robotics & Surgery\n00:31:05 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:32:20 Neocortex vs. Deep Brain\n00:36:45 Decoding Brain Signals\n00:42:08 \u201cConfidence Test\u201d & Electrical Stimulation; RFID Implants\n00:51:33 Bluetooth Headphones & Electromagnetic Fields; Heat\n00:57:43 Brain Augmentation & Paralysis\n01:00:51 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:02:09 Brain Implants & Peripheral Devices\n01:12:44 Brain Machine Interface (BMI), Neurofeedback; Video Games\n01:22:13 Improving Animal Experimentation, Pigs\n01:33:18 Skull & Injury, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n01:39:14 Brain Health, Alcohol\n01:43:34 Neuroplasticity, Brain Lesions & Redundancy \n01:47:32 Car Accidents & Driver Alertness\n01:50:00 Future Possibilities in Brain Augmentation & BMI; Neuralink \n01:58:56 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss neuroplasticity-based skill development and the roles of focus, sleep, movement restriction, and agitation. I then present five key principles of mental visualization to enhance learning speed, accuracy, and consistency. I also provide examples of specific protocols, including repetitions, rest periods, and session frequency, and how to adapt these methods for injuries or breaks from traditional training. Throughout, I reference the scientific studies supporting these concepts. This episode should allow anyone to learn or teach more effectively through the use of mental visualization and training.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman  \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nStatistics of Mental Imagery: https://bit.ly/3H8NR78\nBest practice for motor imagery: a systematic literature review on motor imagery training elements in five different disciplines: https://bit.ly/3UY0RT3\nSleep and the Time Course of Motor Skill Learning: https://bit.ly/41tM9We\nMental practice modulates functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the primary motor cortex: https://bit.ly/3H9kh1H\nMotor Imagery Combined With Physical Training Improves Response Inhibition in the Stop Signal Task: https://bit.ly/3oBlmZJ\nWhat is the relationship between Aphantasia, Synaesthesia and Autism?: https://bit.ly/3V2Tslj\nChapter 15 - Aphantasia: The science of visual imagery extremes: https://bit.ly/3V2Tqdh\nVisual mental imagery and visual perception: Structural equivalence revealed by scanning processes: https://bit.ly/3L0jvoE\nUsing motor imagery practice for improving motor performance \u2013 A review: https://bit.ly/3ApXzyi\nMotor Imagery Combined With Physical Training Improves Response Inhibition in the Stop Signal Task: https://bit.ly/3oBlmZJ\nVisual images preserve metric spatial information: Evidence from studies of image scanning.: https://bit.ly/41OMimY\nAcquisition and consolidation processes following motor imagery practice: https://go.nature.com/3L1udeK\n\nOther Resources\nMobius strip: https://www.britannica.com/science/Mobius-strip \nImpossible cube: https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Impossible_cube  \nRubin\u2019s vase: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_vase \nStop-Signal Task: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/stopsignal.html (Click on \u201cRun the Demo\u201d in the left-hand margin.

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his lab\u2019s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (\u201colfaction\u201d) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of \u201csocial sensing\u201d and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab\u2019s work on digitization of smell \u2014 which may soon allow online communication to include \u201csending of odors\u201d via the internet. Dr. Sobel\u2019s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Smell\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Noam Sobel\nLab website: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg\nLab Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/odorspaceWORG \nPublications: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg/publications \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LabWorg \n\nArticles\nThe Age of Olfactory Bulb Neurons in Humans: https://bit.ly/41NMjb6\nThe Privileged Brain Representation of First Olfactory Associations: https://bit.ly/3LGEePP\nMechanisms of scent-tracking in humans: https://go.nature.com/41Sm03w\nMeasuring and Characterizing the Human Nasal Cycle: https://bit.ly/44dqGmi\nHuman non-olfactory cognition phase-locked with inhalation: https://go.nature.com/44iPIQQ\nA social chemosignaling function for human handshaking: https://bit.ly/3Lo5kK6\nThere is chemistry in social chemistry: https://bit.ly/41TVIhq\nMHC-dependent mate preferences in humans: https://bit.ly/41SbgCc\nAn Exteroceptive Block to Pregnancy in the Mouse: https://go.nature.com/3VnxRnN\nFear-Related Chemosignals Modulate Recognition of Fear in Ambiguous Facial Expressions: https://bit.ly/3NqAPpD\nSniffing the human body volatile hexadecanal blocks aggression in men but triggers aggression in women: https://bit.ly/3oQ6NBv\nMenstrual Synchrony and Suppression: https://go.nature.com/3LRF9xf\nRegulation of ovulation by human pheromones: https://go.nature.com/44jODbt\nHuman Tears Contain a Chemosignal: https://bit.ly/41Qmkjr\nWhy Only Humans Shed Emotional Tears: https://bit.ly/41W71pl\nRevisiting the revisit: added evidence for a social chemosignal in human emotional tears: https://bit.ly/44dygNJ\nIncrease of tear volume in dogs after reunion with owners is mediated by oxytocin: https://bit.ly/41W73gX\nAn olfactory self-test effectively screens for COVID-19: https://go.nature.com/3Vj6z1S\n\nOther Resources\nJoachim L\u00f6w video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOstSv7SrRU \nOsmo: https://osmo.ai \nOdor Space: https://odorspace.weizmann.ac.il \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Noam Sobel\n00:03:46 Sponsors: ROKA, Thesis, Helix Sleep\n00:06:46 Olfaction Circuits (Smell)\n00:14:49 Loss & Regeneration of Smell, Illness\n00:21:39 Brain Processing of Smell\n00:24:40 Smell & Memories\n00:27:52 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:29:07 Humans & Odor Tracking\n00:39:25 The Alternating Nasal Cycle & Autonomic Nervous System\n00:48:18 Cognitive Processing & Breathing\n00:54:47 Neurodegenerative Diseases & Olfaction \n01:00:12 Congenital Anosmia\n01:05:01 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:06:19 Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals & Social Sensing\n01:15:07 Smelling Ourselves & Smelling Others \n01:22:02 Odors & Romantic Attraction\n01:24:58 Vomeronasal Organ, \u201cBruce Effect\u201d & Miscarriage\n01:40:20 Social Chemo-Signals, Fear\n01:50:26 Chemo-Signaling, Aggression & Offspring\n02:03:57 Menstrual Cycle Synchronization\n02:12:11 Sweat, Tears, Emotions & Testosterone\n02:27:46 Science Politics \n02:37:54 Food Odors & Nutritional Value\n02:45:34 Human Perception & Odorant Similarity \n02:52:12 Digitizing Smell, COVID-19 & Smell\n03:05:50 Medical Diagnostic Future & Olfaction Digitization\n03:10:55 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair \u201cdead\u201d (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress. This episode explains the mechanisms underlying hair regrowth tools and the science behind them so that you can evaluate potential treatments and associated side-effect profiles and select the best one(s) for you. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #HairGrowth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hu.berman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nMicroneedling and Its Use in Hair Loss Disorders: A Systematic Review: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13555-021-00653-2\nCaffeine and Its Pharmacological Benefits in the Management of Androgenetic Alopecia: A Review: https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/508228\nThe effectiveness of combination therapies for androgenetic alopecia: A systematic review and meta-analysis: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dth.13741\nDifferential effects of caffeine on hair shaft elongation, matrix and outer root sheath keratinocyte proliferation, and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b22/insulin\u2010like growth factor\u20101\u2010mediated regulation of the hair cycle in male and female human hair follicles in vitro: https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article-abstract/171/5/1031/6616284?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false\nThe structure of people\u2019s hair: https://peerj.com/articles/619/\n\nNote: The Huberman Lab podcast has no affiliation with or financial benefit from any of the products listed below, which are provided as a useful reference only.\n\nKetoconazole Shampoos\nKeeps: https://www.keeps.com/our-products/ketoconazole \nNurx: https://www.nurx.com/topical/ketoconazole-2-shampoo/fb/ \nSiena Health: https://www.sienahealth.com/product/ketoconazole-shampoo-2 \nIntelligent: https://intelligent.shop/products/intelligent-shampoo\n\nBiotin Shampoos\nMaple Holisitics: https://www.amazon.com/Biotin-Hair-Shampoo-Thinning-Moisturizing/dp/B01ENCBOA0 \nOuai: https://theouai.com/collections/shampoo-conditioner/products/fine-hair-shampoo \nR+Co: https://www.randco.com/collections/dallas-collection/products/dallas-biotin-thickening-shampoo \n\nMicroneedling https://www.amazon.com/s?k=microneedling+hair+2mm&crid=OOD2YAB5CQXN&sprefix=microneedling+hair+2mm%2Caps%2C168&ref=nb_sb_noss \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Hair\n00:04:13 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, HVMN, ROKA\n00:08:04 Psychological States & Hair\n00:13:19 Hair Anatomy & Stem Cells\n00:26:05 3 Phases of Hair Growth\n00:35:40 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:55 Minoxidil & Blood Flow\n00:45:37 Increase Blood Flow: Massage, Tadalafil, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), Microneedling\n00:56:10 Microneedling, Minoxidil & \u201cDead Zones\u201d\n01:00:13 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:01:25 Botox Treatments\n01:06:27 Androgens, Hair Growth & Pattern Hair Loss; Scalp vs. Beard Hair\n01:15:46 Topical Caffeine & Slowing Hair Loss\n01:21:06 IGF-1: Growth Hormone & Sermorelin; Insulin Sensitivity: Myo-Inositol\n01:25:52 Iron & Hair Growth\n01:27:04 5-Alpha Reductase & Saw Palmetto; Curcumin \n01:33:22 Ketoconazole & Offsetting Hair Loss\n01:38:46 Topical & Oral Finasteride \n01:51:00 Post- Finasteride Syndrome\n01:56:01 Dutasteride\n01:58:53 Mechanical & Chemical Stimulation for Hair Growth\n02:02:46 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Elissa Epel, Ph.D., professor and vice chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and the author of a new book entitled \u201cThe Stress Prescription.\u201d We discuss her work showing how stress impacts mood, eating behavior, mental health, physical health, and aging. She explains stress intervention tools using \u201ctop-down\u201d techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing), body-based methods (e.g., breathwork) including the Wim Hof Method, exercise, meditation, body scans, and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology, and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Dr. Epel provides a wide range of tools shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving various aspects of our health.\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Elissa Epel\nUCSF profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/elissa.epel \nPersonal website: https://www.elissaepel.com \nLab Website (Aging, Metabolism & Emotion Center): https://amecenter.ucsf.edu \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dr_epel \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/elissa.epel \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elissa-epel \n\nArticles\nThe geroscience agenda: Toxic stress, hormetic stress, and the rate of aging: https://bit.ly/3nAgNhD\nTHE IMPACT OF MEANINGFUL VOLUNTEER ENGAGEMENT IN AGING ADULTS: THE BALTIMORE EXPERIENCE CORPS TRIAL: https://bit.ly/3KpyJoa\nPotential role for adult neurogenesis in the encoding of time in new memories: https://go.nature.com/3U0gwkl\nThe mindful moms training: development of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce stress and overeating during pregnancy: https://bit.ly/3ZzueM3\nCan Meditation Slow Rate of Cellular Aging?

I also explain how to leverage dopamine dynamics to overcome procrastination. I cover behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools to optimize baseline and peak dopamine levels to ensure a persistently motivated state. I also discuss how to boost motivation when you are in a rut, why you might not want to stack behaviors/substances that spike dopamine and how to build and maintain a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d for pursuing goals of any kind. Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.\n\n#HubermanLab #Dopamine #Motivation \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPain modulates dopamine neurons via a spinal\u2013parabrachial\u2013mesencephalic circuit: https://go.nature.com/3FPaFIH\nDopamine, Updated: Reward Prediction Error and Beyond: https://bit.ly/3Gha0A7\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3IumXX1\nEffect of tyrosine on cognitive function and blood pressure under stress: https://bit.ly/3LSSHZq\nTyrosine Improves Working Memory in a Multitasking Environment: https://bit.ly/3LSgCZ6\n\nBooks\nDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence: https://amzn.to/3TIWfj2\n\nOther Resources\nNon-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dopamine\n00:02:32 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, WHOOP, ROKA, Momentous\n00:06:27 Dopamine Brain Circuits \n00:14:53 Goals & Addiction\n00:17:13 Dopamine Dynamics, \u201cWave Pool\u201d analogy\n00:20:28 Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error\n00:28:26 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:29:40 Feedback Cues & Reward Contingent Learning, \u201cScoreboard\u201d\n00:37:40 Addiction; Pleasure & Pain Imbalance\n00:44:55 Dopamine Release & Addictive Substances/Behaviors\n00:50:43 Addiction Recovery, Binding Behaviors\n00:53:25 Tools: Maintain Baseline Dopamine Levels\n01:02:08 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:26 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n01:09:38 Prescriptions & Supplementation: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n01:18:58 Dopamine Trough Recovery, Postpartum Depression\n01:23:31 Dopamine Dynamics, \u201cDopamine Stacking\u201d; Intrinsic Motivation\n01:38:10 Making Effort the Reward, Growth Mindset\n01:41:49 Tool: Overcome Procrastination\n01:52:16 Tool: Meditation & Procrastination\n01:57:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Dr. Attia is host of the health and medicine podcast, The Drive, and the author of a new book, \u201cOutlive: The Science & Art of Longevity,\u201d which examines disease prevention and healthy aging, including emotional health. He explains the leading causes of death worldwide and how to measure one\u2019s risk of death and mitigate each risk factor. Dr. Attia shares how, in addition to blood-based markers of lipids and hormones, there are behavioral measures and interventions, and key aspects of emotional health (i.e., relationships, emotional stability, purpose, etc.) that fundamentally impact our physical health and longevity, and how to assess and adjust our emotional health. This episode is rich with actionable information related to disease screening and biomarker testing, nutritional, exercise, behavior and prescription-based tools that area useful to all people regardless of age, male or female, and that can significantly improve vitality, health and lifespan.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman  \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Peter Attia\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nThe Peter Attia Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd \n\nArticles\nA Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind: https://bit.ly/40ccfw8\n\nBooks\nOutlive: The Science & Art of Longevity book: https://peterattiamd.com/outlive\nThe Road to Character: https://amzn.to/42nMx9H\n\nOther Resources\nWithings Blood Pressure Cuff: https://amzn.to/47TJ6tQ\nOmron Blood Pressure Cuff: https://amzn.to/41kLirQ\nPrenuvo Whole-Body MRI: https://www.prenuvo.com \nBiograph: https://www.biograph.com \nThe Fentanyl Crisis and Why Everyone Should Be Paying Attention (The Drive podcast episode): https://peterattiamd.com/anthonyhipolito\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Peter Attia\n00:03:22 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, LMNT, HVMN, Momentous\n00:07:34 Lifespan vs. Healthspan\n00:10:54 \u201c4 Horseman of Death\u201d, Diseases of Atherosclerosis\n00:14:44 Tool: Hypertension & Stroke, Blood Pressure Testing \n00:23:14 Preventing Atherosclerosis, Smoking & Vaping, Pollution\n00:32:24 Sponsor: AG-1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:33:29 Cholesterol, ApoB\n00:42:21 Cholesterol Levels, LDL & ApoB Testing\n00:49:29 ApoB Levels & Atherosclerosis, Causality\n01:01:06 ApoB Reduction, Insulin Resistance, Statins, Ezetimibe, PCSK9 Inhibitors\n01:12:30 Monitoring ApoB\n01:17:12 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:18:30 Reducing Blood Pressure, Exercise & Sleep\n01:20:50 High Blood Pressure & Kidneys\n01:23:11 Alcohol, Sleep & Disease Risk\n01:31:21 Cancer & Cancer Risks: Genetics, Smoking & Obesity\n01:39:47 Cancer Screening & Survival\n01:44:17 Radiation Risks, CT & PET Scans\n01:48:48 Environmental Carcinogens\n01:52:11 Genetic & Whole-Body MRI Screening, Colonoscopy\n01:58:47 Neurodegenerative Diseases, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, ApoE\n02:08:08 Alzheimer\u2019s Disease & Amyloid\n02:13:58 Interventions for Brain Health, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n02:21:26 Accidental Death, \u201cDeaths of Despair\u201d, Fentanyl Crisis\n02:31:20 Fall Risk & Stability, 4 Pillars of Strength Training\n02:41:05 Emotional Health\n02:53:45 Mortality & Preserving Relationship Quality\n03:02:20 Relationships vs. Outcomes, Deconstructing Emotions\n03:09:34 Treatment Centers, Emotional Processing & Recovery\n03:16:34 Tool: Inner Monologue & Anger, Redirecting Self-Talk\n03:27:37 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We discuss his lab\u2019s discovery that \u201ctime-restricted eating\u201d (TRE) aka intermittent fasting, is beneficial effects for metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.\n\n#HubermanLab #IntermittentFasting\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Satchin Panda\nSalk Institute: https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda \nPanda Lab: https://panda.salk.edu \nPublications: https://panda.salk.edu/publications \nSupport Dr. Panda\u2019s Research: https://panda.salk.edu/giving \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SatchinPanda\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/satchin.panda \n\nOther Resources\nMy Circadian Clock app: https://mycircadianclock.org \nOntime Health app: https://getontimehealth.com \n\nArticles\nRevival of light signalling in the postmortem mouse and human retina: https://go.nature.com/3ZWnGro\nCircadian alignment of early onset caloric restriction promotes longevity in male C57BL/6J mice: https://bit.ly/3ywruE3\nTime-restricted eating with or without low-carbohydrate diet reduces visceral fat and improves metabolic syndrome: A randomized trial: http://bit.ly/3LeBdqg\nEmbers of society: Firelight talk among the Ju/\u2019hoansi Bushmen: https://bit.ly/3l65LzK\nCircadian Entrainment to the Natural Light-Dark Cycle across Seasons and the Weekend: http://bit.ly/3LhsWlm\nFeasibility of time-restricted eating and impacts on cardiometabolic health in 24-h shift workers: The Healthy Heroes randomized control trial: http://bit.ly/3FeR1FC\nAccess to Electric Light Is Associated with Shorter Sleep Duration in a Traditionally Hunter-Gatherer Community: https://bit.ly/3LivSyj\nDaily Eating Patterns and Their Impact on Health and Disease: https://bit.ly/3YGIHW6\n\nBooks\nThe Circadian Code: https://amzn.to/3FixpAv\nThe Circadian Diabetes Code: https://amzn.to/3FiU7Zm\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Satchin Panda\n00:03:02 Sponsors: HVMN, Eight Sleep, Thesis, Momentous\n00:07:24 Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health \n00:14:38 Mealtimes & Circadian Clock\n00:21:34 Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion\n00:25:28 Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat \n00:32:49 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:34:04 CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity\n00:47:20 Gender, Hormones & CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)\n00:52:40 Physical Activity, Nutrition & Feeding Window\n00:59:04 Nutrition Timing, Quality & Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet \n01:03:00 Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast\n01:15:07 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:16:20 Circadian Rhythm, \u201cNight Owls\u201d & Genetics \n01:26:37 Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, \u201cMe Time\u201d \n01:30:08 Light Sensitivity & \u201cNight Owls\u201d; Puberty, Melatonin\n01:36:05 Shift Workers, Health & Disease\n01:45:43 Artificial Lights, Young Adults & Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction \n01:50:59 Firefighters, Sleep & TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose\n02:05:18 Shift Workers & Sleep; Alcohol & Caffeine\n02:09:15 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults & Children, Sleep\n02:22:10 Meal Timing\n02:25:20 \u201cComplete Fast\u201d, Longer Fasts, Physical Health & Mental Health\n02:28:12 \u201cFat Fasting\u201d, Blood Glucose & Insulin \n02:31:57 Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin & Longevity; Human Applicability?\n02:39:14 Circadian Rhythm & Metabolism\n02:41:36 Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App\n02:46:17 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water\u2019s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called \u201cpH water\u201d or \u201calkalized water\u201d to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.).

    "short_description": "In this episode, my guest is Oded Rechavi, Ph.D., professor of neurobiology at Tel Aviv University and expert in how genes are inherited, how experiences shape genes and remarkably, how some memories of experiences can be passed via genes to offspring. We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the \u201cheritability of acquired traits\u201d and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi\u2019s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Rechavi \nAcademic Profile: https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/profile/odedrech_66 \nLab Website: https://www.odedrechavilab.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OdedRechavi \nTEDx Talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/oded_rechavi_transgenerational_biology?language=en  \n\nArticles\nNeuronal Small RNAs Control Behavior Transgenerationally: https://bit.ly/2HZxrzO\nTransgenerational Inheritance of an Acquired Small RNA-Based Antiviral Response in C. elegans: https://bit.ly/41xRf47\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Oded Rechavi\n00:02:08 Sponsors: ROKA, HVMN, Eight Sleep\n00:06:04 DNA, RNA, Protein; Somatic vs. Germ Cells\n00:14:36 Lamarckian Evolution, Inheritance of Acquired Traits\n00:22:54 Paul Kammerer & Toad Morphology\n00:28:52 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:30:06 James McConnell & Memory Transfer\n00:37:31 Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics \n00:45:13 Epigenetic Reprogramming; Imprinted Genes \n00:50:43 Nature vs. Nurture; Epigenetics & Offspring\n00:59:06 Generational Epigenetic Inheritance \n01:09:03 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:10:20 Model Organisms, C. elegans\n01:21:50 C. elegans & Inheritance of Acquired Traits, Small RNAs\n01:26:02 RNA Interference, C. elegans & Virus Immunity\n01:34:13 RNA Amplification, Multi-Generational Effects\n01:38:41 Response Duration & Environment\n01:47:50 Generational Memory Transmission, RNA\n01:59:36 Germ Cells & Behavior; Body Cues\n02:04:48 Transmission of Sexual Choice\n02:11:22 Fertility & Human Disease; 3-Parent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); RNA Testing\n02:17:56 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Learning & Memory\n02:29:26 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, \u201cWim Hof Method,\u201d Pr\u0101n\u0101y\u0101ma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why \u201coverbreathing\u201d is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups. Breathwork practices are zero-cost and require minimal time yet provide a unique and powerful avenue to improve overall quality of life that is grounded in clear physiology.

We discuss her research exploring how sleep impacts learning, memory, hormones and emotions. She discusses tools to enhance your quality of sleep, increase deep sleep, rapid eye movement sleep and growth hormone release-- a key hormone for health, immune function and vitality. Dr. Poe explains how a specific brain area, the locus coeruleus, facilitates the processing of emotions, helps relieve traumas and how to maximize locus coeruleus function. She also explains sleep\u2019s vital role in opiate addiction recovery and how anyone can determine their optimal sleep timing and duration. This episode is rich with basic science information and zero-cost tools to enhance quality and effectiveness of sleep for sake of mental health, physical health and performance.\n\n#HubermanLab #Sleep #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Gina Poe \nUCLA Academic Profile: https://bri.ucla.edu/people/gina-poe-ph-d\nUCLA Integrative Biology & Physiology Profile: https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/faculty/gina-poe\nSleep Lab: https://poe-sleeplab.weebly.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/doctorpoe \nTED talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/gina_poe_your_brain_s_work_during_sleep \n\nArticles\nRecurrent Hippocampo-neocortical sleep-state divergence in humans: https://bit.ly/40JTJMB\nLocus coeruleus: a new look at the blue spot: https://go.nature.com/3xj4DLI\nWhy are women so vulnerable to anxiety, trauma-related and stress-related disorders?

    "short_description": "In this episode 5 of a 6-part special series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton, he explains how to optimize post-training recovery and how to avoid overtraining in order to better achieve your fitness and exercise goals. He explains the cellular mechanisms of muscle soreness and pain, why adequate recovery is essential for all physical adaptations, and how to enhance recovery using breathwork, thermal, movement, and pressure-based techniques. He describes how overtraining impedes exercise progress and how to assess if you are overreaching or overtraining, by using specific biomarkers and indicators. Like other performance metrics, recovery is a skill that can and should be trained, and that can be learned. This episode provides an actionable toolkit for how to monitor and improve your exercise recovery abilities, which will improve your overall mental and physical health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Recovery #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hu.berman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Andy Galpin\nAcademic Profile: http://hhd.fullerton.edu/knes/faculty...\nWebsite: https://www.andygalpin.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drandygalpin\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/drandygalpin\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3R2e3zYxWwIhMKV36Qhkw\n\nArticles\nBrief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal: https://bit.ly/3xleMHI\nAltered brown fat thermoregulation and enhanced cold-induced thermogenesis in young, healthy, winter-swimming men: https://bit.ly/3YuoDa4\n\nOther Resources\nCarbon Dioxide Tolerance Clip (Galpin Guest Series Episode 3): https://youtu.be/oNkDA2F7CjM \nSHIFT Breathwork Assessment: https://shiftadapt.com/breathwork\nBMJ tool for visualizing the variability of lab test results: https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m149/rapid-responses\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Recovery\n00:04:17 Exercise & Delayed Muscle Soreness, Pain\n00:11:35 Muscle Spindles, Reduce Soreness\n00:18:56 Exercise, Homeostasis & Hormesis; Blood Test & Fitness Level\n00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization\n00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels\n00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery\n00:47:28 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining\n00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork\n01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing\n01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature\n01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility\n01:20:44 InsideTracker\n01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques\n01:24:34 Monitoring for Overreaching & Overtraining\n01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep\n01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol\n01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation\n02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep\n02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\n02:15:07 Tool: \u201cAcute State Shifters\u201d, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones\n02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training\n02:29:01 Tool: \u201cChronic State Shifters\u201d\n02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy\n02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery \n02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers\n02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution\n03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements\n03:03:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "This is episode 3 of a 6-part special series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton. He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes. Anyone wishing to improve their physical health and performance stands to benefit from the information.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Andy Galpin\nAcademic Profile: http://hhd.fullerton.edu/knes/facultystaff/AndyGalpin.php\nWebsite: https://www.andygalpin.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drandygalpin\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/drandygalpin\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3R2e3zYxWwIhMKV36Qhkw\n\nArticles\nExercise Snacks: A Novel Strategy to Improve Cardiometabolic Health: http://bit.ly/3Rp7UlP\nThe Effects of Acute Exercise on Mood, Cognition, Neurophysiology, and Neurochemical Pathways: A Review:  https://bit.ly/3HniYv5\n\nOther Resources\nExercise Snacks: https://beyond.ubc.ca/exercise-snacks\nSHIFT Breathing Gears: https://youtu.be/u8kxddDHj90\nSHIFT Breathing Assessment: https://shiftadapt.com/breathwork\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Endurance: Benefits, Mechanics & Breathing \n00:07:30 Tool: \u201cExercise Snacks\u201d\n00:14:21 Momentous, Levels, LMNT\n00:18:01 Endurance Categories\n00:22:16 Fat Loss & Respiration; Carbon Cycles & Storage, Metabolism\n00:33:08 Exhalation Rates, Exercise & Fat Loss; Calories \n00:41:47 Cardiovascular Adaptations, Cardiac Output & Maximum Heart Rate\n00:47:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:47:55 Excess Post-Exercise Consumption (EPOC); Exercise Intensity & Fat vs. Carbohydrate Energy Utilization\n00:59:35 Tool: Training for Fat Loss, Carbohydrate Stores, Liver Glycogen & Fatigue\n01:08:01 Metabolic Flexibility, Carbohydrates & Fat; Exercise & Flexible Fuel Utilization \n01:16:07 Muscle & Basal Metabolic Rate\n01:19:40 InsideTracker\n01:20:43 Assessing Metabolic Flexibility, Blood Glucose, Carbohydrates\n01:27:48 Caffeine, High-Carbohydrate Meals & Timing, Managing Daily Energy \n01:36:42 Cellular Energy (ATP) Production from Carbs; Lactate; Anerobic, Aerobic\n01:50:45 Lactate, Energy Production Buffer\n01:53:14 Fuel Sources & Exercise; Mitochondria, Oxygen Availability & Lactate\n02:02:50 Lactate for Exercise & Cognitive Performance\n02:04:33 Energy Production, Waste Management & Endurance Exercise; Insulin\n02:12:49 Protein & Fat Utilization for Energy; Exercise & Fat Loss\n02:21:20 Protein as Fuel Source, Fire Analogy \n02:26:39 Low-Carbohydrate Diet & Performance\n02:29:40 Muscular Endurance: Fuel Sources, Training & Capillarization\n02:37:30 Tool: Muscular Endurance & Modifiable Variables; Examples\n02:45:07 Anerobic Capacity: Fuel Sources, Training & Oxygen Utilization \n02:49:23 Tool: Cardiac Output, Heart Rate Zones & Breathing \u201cGear System\u201d\n02:58:10 Tool: Anerobic Capacity & Modifiable Variables; Examples, Nasal Recovery\n03:11:45 Tool: \u201cSugarcane\u201d Endurance Protocol \n03:14:02 Anerobic Capacity, Training Progression \n03:16:40 Tool: Maximum Aerobic Output, Training & Modifiable Variables\n03:21:58 Tool: Long Duration Endurance, Training, Circuits\n03:25:13 Long Duration Endurance, Capillarization, Fatigue & Breathwork, Technique\n03:29:10 Weekly Combination Training, Metabolic Flexibility & Longevity\n03:37:23 Tool: Mixed Endurance Training, Half Marathon Example\n03:47:33 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

Our conversation covers a breadth of training topics, including selecting the number of repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods, warm-ups, exercise cadence, breathing, stretching, recovery, training frequency, overcoming plateaus, nutrition, and he gives specific examples of exercises for power, strength, and hypertrophy.\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Andy Galpin\nAcademic Profile: http://hhd.fullerton.edu/knes/facultystaff/AndyGalpin.php\nWebsite: https://www.andygalpin.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drandygalpin\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/drandygalpin\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3R2e3zYxWwIhMKV36Qhkw\n\nArticles\nSarcoplasmic Hypertrophy in Skeletal Muscle: A Scientific \u201cUnicorn\u201d or Resistance Training Adaptation?: https://bit.ly/3j4sXxq\nTowards an improved understanding of proximity-to-failure in resistance training and its influence on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage, and perceived discomfort: A scoping review: https://bit.ly/3Dd9MIy\n\nOther Resources\nAndy Galpin: Science of Muscle Hypertrophy: https://youtu.be/MyKrc-fheBw\nPrilepin\u2019s Chart: https://bit.ly/3XD9Nxw\nCable Core Rotation: https://bit.ly/3WDihnd\nEric Cressey: https://ericcressey.com \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Benefits of Strength & Hypertrophy Training, Aging\n00:10:52 Strength & Hypertrophy Training, Aesthetics \n00:14:02 Momentous, Eight Sleep, Levels\n00:17:48 Strength vs. Hypertrophy Training: Adaptations\n00:22:42 Ligaments, Tendons & Resistance Training\n00:28:05 Bone Strength & Resistance Training, Age, Women\n00:32:38 Strength Training & Major Adaptations\n00:41:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens) \n00:42:25 Hypertrophy Training & Major Adaptations; Protein Synthesis\n00:45:56 Endurance vs. Strength Training & Cell Signaling, Protein Synthesis\n00:52:26 Muscle Hypertrophy, Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy\n00:56:37 Muscle Physiology & Plasticity, Muscle \u201cMemory\u201d\n01:04:00 Non-Negotiables & Modifiable Variables of Exercise Training\n01:11:51 InsideTracker\n01:12:53 Tool: Speed & Power Training, \u201c3 to 5\u201d Approach, Periodization, Planning \n01:22:02 Warming Up & Training, Dynamic Movements\n01:30:55 Strength vs. Hypertrophy Repetition Cadence, Triphasic Training\n01:44:03 Tool: Breathing & Training, Valsalva Technique\n01:53:22 Tool: Training Auto-Regulation, Specificity vs. Variation, Prilepin's Chart\n02:02:35 Training to Failure, Exercise Selection & Recovery, Standardization\n 02:13:45 Tool: Power vs. Strength Training & Modifiable Variables; Supersets \n02:24:22 Sets & Rest Periods; Stretching\n02:28:48 Tools: Power Training & Modifiable Variables; Examples\n02:30:16 Tools: Strength Training & Modifiable Variables, Cluster Sets, Dynamic Variable Sets\n02:40:44 Power & Strength Training Protocols\n02:43:37 Intention, Focus & Exercise\n02:47:29 Hypertrophy Training Program, Muscle Growth & Signaling \n02:55:12 Tools: Hypertrophy Training & Modifiable Variables; Examples\n03:03:02 Balanced Muscle Development & Hypertrophy\n03:09:04 Tools: Hypertrophy Training & Modifiable Variables; Splits\n03:23:08 \u201cNon-Responders\u201d & Exercise Plateaus, Volume\n03:27:06 Hypertrophy, Repetition & Rest Ranges, Muscle Failure, \u201cChaos Management\u201d\n03:37:39 Frequency & Workout Duration, Splits\n03:44:52 Training Frequency, Infrequent Training, Intermediate Repetition Ranges\n03:55:22 Hypertrophy, Muscle Damage & Recovery\n04:01:15 Combining Cardiovascular & Hypertrophy Training, Interference Effect\n04:06:22 Hypertrophy Training Protocols \n04:12:06 Tool: Neck & Rear Deltoid Exercises, Stabilization & Hypertrophy\n04:14:42 Hypertrophy: Reps, Sets & Progression, \u201cHidden\u201d Stressors, Exercises to Avoid\n04:21:09 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Hypertrophy vs. Strength\n04:26:41 Nutrition, Timing & Strength/Hypertrophy; Creatine\n04:38:04 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover the nutrition-based, behavioral, supplement-based and prescription approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertility\u2014several of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children. The tools and principles I discuss can also improve overall vitality and longevity in all people, regardless of age. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nEffects of mobile phone usage on sperm quality \u2013 No time-dependent relationship on usage: A systematic review and updated meta-analysis: https://bit.ly/3Horf39\nAcupuncture and herbal medicine for female infertility: An overview of systematic reviews: https://bit.ly/3D6QyUW\nEffect of Zinc Administration on Plasma Testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone, and Sperm Count: https://bit.ly/3XThteZ\nCannabis and Male Fertility: A Systematic Review: https://bit.ly/3iXAyOi\nTanner Stages: https://bit.ly/3HnYXpo\nLink Between Body Fat and the Timing of Puberty: https://bit.ly/3Wz9nH8\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Fertility, Vitality & Longevity\n00:04:24 Maui Nui Venison, Eight Sleep, Momentous\n00:08:20 Eggs & Sperm, Genes, Fertilization\n00:18:28 Puberty: Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH), Melatonin & Leptin\n00:23:38 Onset Trends of Puberty, Odors Effects\n00:31:24 Female Puberty, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)\n00:35:25 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:34 Ovulatory & Menstrual Cycle\n00:40:36 Follicular Phase: Egg Maturation & Ovulation, FSH & Estrogen\n00:51:09 Luteal Phase: Progesterone & Estrogen, Menstruation \n00:58:14 Ovulation & Libido; Luteal Phase & Malaise; Individual Variability\n01:03:14 Inside Tracker\n01:04:18 Sex Chromosomes, Sperm\n01:11:40 Tool: Testicular Temperature & Fertility\n01:17:22 Sperm Production, Seminal Fluid, Vasectomy \n01:24:07 Sperm Cells, Mitochondria & Motility, Intercourse Frequency & Fertilization\n01:28:31 Sperm Production, GnRH, FSH, LH & Testosterone \n01:36:21 Ejaculate Quality, Sperm Counts, Fertilization, Ectopic Pregnancy\n01:44:14 Tool: Sexual Intercourse Frequency & Fertilization\n01:53:24 Tools: Tracking Ovulation, Libido, Lubricants \n01:56:42 Fecundability: Egg Quality & Woman\u2019s Age, Cumulative Pregnancy Rate\n02:08:17 Miscarriages, Chromosomal Abnormalities\n02:11:23 Female Fertility: Age, Follicle Testing & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Testing \n02:18:51 Male Fertility: Sperm Analysis, Age\n02:24:52 Fertility & Hormone Analysis, Age\n02:29:07 Fertility Effects of Sleep, Cortisol/Stress, Cannabis/Nicotine & Alcohol \n02:42:40 Fertility, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), Viral Infection & Cystic Fibrosis\n02:47:42 Tool: Testicular Temperature & Fertility\n02:51:26 Tool: Phones & Sperm Quality \n02:58:06 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Fertility, Testicular Temperature, Cortisol/Stress\n03:05:43 Fertility, Exercise & Mitochondrial Health; Intermittent Fasting\n03:14:46 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Sperm Production; Supplements\n03:20:36 Sex Determination in Offspring, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), Sperm Fractions\n03:32:23 Postcoital Female Position & Fertilization, Sperm Quality\n03:36:57 Cannabis & Sperm Motility, Libido, Pregnancy\n03:42:33 Acupuncture, Fertility & Pregnancy\n03:49:25 Fertility Supplements: L-Carnitine & Allicin, Coenzyme Q10 \n03:56:18 Fertility Supplements: Inositol, Omega 3 Fatty Acids  \n04:02:50 Supplements for Hormones: Tongkat Ali, Shilajit, Zinc\n04:13:02 Fertility & Prescription Medications\n04:16:44 Human Reproduction & Fertility\n04:20:12 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

He is also the author of a new book, \"The Creative Act: A Way of Being,\" which explores the creative process and how to access creativity. We discuss topics such as finding inspiration, the role of feelings as guideposts, learning from observing nature, balancing self-doubt and anxiety, and adopting new perspectives to channel the creative process. Rick also shares his thoughts on using deadlines, eliminating distractions, and how our experiences and emotions influence the creative process. Additionally, we discuss his love for professional wrestling. Our conversation can be applied to any activity or profession to access creativity.\n\n#HubermanLab #RickRubin #Creativity \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nRick Rubin \nThe Creative Act: A Way of Being: https://amzn.to/3QFEuj9\nWebsite: https://tetragrammaton.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RickRubin\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rickrubin\n\nOther Resources\nMonroe Institute Meditations: https://www.monroeinstitute.org/products/the-surgical-support-series \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Rick Rubin\n00:04:08 Maui Nui Venison, Thesis, WHOOP, Momentous\n00:08:23 Creativity & Ideas, Cloud Analogy \n00:12:26 Language & Creativity; Kids\n00:17:36 Feelings & Creative Ideas\n00:22:01 Rules, Choice & Art; Personal Taste & Other\u2019s Opinions \n00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity\n00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:35:04 Scientific Knowledge; Opinions & Art\n00:41:27 Finishing Projects; The Source & Nature\n00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty\n00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes\n01:03:03 InsideTracker\n01:04:14 Focus, Disengaging & Subconscious; Anxiety \n01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work\n01:18:26 Process & \u201cCloud\u201d; Perception & Storytelling\n01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering the Inverse\n01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine \n01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance\n01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia\n02:01:56 Sleep, Waking Up & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas\n02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines\n02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance\n02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity  \n02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other\u2019s Opinions \n02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition \n02:39:44 \u201cLook for Clues\u201d, Belief Effects \n02:46:25 Attention, Emotion & Art\n02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation \n02:57:33 Rick Rubin Questions, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

When most people hear about \u201csupplements,\u201d they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can\u2019t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss \u201cfoundational\u201d supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.\n\n#HubermanLab #Supplements #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nEurycoma longifolia (Jack) Improves Serum Total Testosterone in Men: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials: https://bit.ly/3QnuCdJ\n\nResources\nExamine: https://examine.com \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Supplements\n00:03:38 Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol\n00:11:51 Momentous, LMNT, Helix Sleep\n00:15:38 Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule\n00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens\n00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition\n00:33:06 Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog\n00:35:59 InsideTracker\n00:36:44 Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements\n00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs\n00:43:45 Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine\n00:50:52 Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin\n00:55:55 Melatonin Caution\n00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects\n01:02:45 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n01:03:53 Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health\n01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root \n01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions \n01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork \n01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido \n01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility\n01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine \n01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine \n01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements\n01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein \n01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements\n01:55:25 A Rational Supplementation Protocol\n01:58:36 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.\n\n#HubermanLab #Creativity #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nOpen monitoring meditation reduces the involvement of brain regions related to memory function: https://go.nature.com/3V6s6Jt\nThe (b)link between creativity and dopamine: Spontaneous eye blink rates predict and dissociate divergent and convergent thinking: https://bit.ly/3v3nlWG\nIncreased dopamine tone during meditation-induced change of consciousness: https://bit.ly/3PJATjC\nExploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open-label natural setting: https://bit.ly/3FHf3Zv\nA new method for training creativity: narrative as an alternative to divergent thinking: https://bit.ly/3FH0chB\nMore creative through positive mood?

    "short_description": "My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding \u201cthe self\u201d and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one\u2019s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (\u201cchatter\u201d) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam\u2019s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.\n\n#HubermanLab #SamHarris #Meditation\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Special Offer for Waking Up\nhttps://www.wakingup.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Sam Harris\nWaking Up app: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMaking Sense podcast: https://www.samharris.org/podcasts \nWebsite: https://www.samharris.org \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@samharrisorg\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg\n\nBooks\nWaking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion: https://amzn.to/3Z51pIb\nMaking Sense: Conversations on Consciousness, Morality, and the Future of Humanity: https://amzn.to/3CgbIQ3\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Sam Harris \n00:04:36 Levels, WHOOP, Eight Sleep, Momentous\n00:08:54 Sense of Self & Meditation, Dualism of Self\n00:18:07 Sense of Self in Brain & Body \n00:25:28 Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation\n00:28:25 Interrupting Sense of Self & Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade \n00:33:30 Observer & Actor, Default Mode Network & Meditation, Blind Spot\n00:40:48 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:41:57 Mediation & Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience\n00:57:32 Sense of Self throughout Evolution \n01:07:40 Sense of Self from Human Development, Language\n01:18:42 InsideTracker\n01:19:46 Internal Dialogue, Distractibility & Mindfulness \n01:26:27 Time Perception & Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance & Pain\n01:37:13 Consciousness & Sense of Control, Free Will\n01:43:14 Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling & Ideas, Free Will\n01:52:11 Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self\n02:06:44 Meditation & Concentration Practice \n02:11:58 Mindfulness, \u201cSkylike Mind\u201d & Thoughts\n02:15:11 States of Self & Context, Dualistic Experiences\n02:32:39 Distraction & Identification of Thoughts, Meditation & \u201cFlow\u201d States\n02:42:58 Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues & Social Interactions\n02:54:59 Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions\n03:05:58 Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion\n03:21:11 Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys & Inner Truths\n03:29:48 Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution & Thought Expansion\n03:40:09 Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present\n03:54:29 Leaving Twitter; Conflict, Life Interruption & Politics \n04:06:14 Social Media, Attentional Disruption & Deep Work\n04:15:39 Meditation & Sense of Self\n04:19:02 Sam Harris & Waking Up App, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

    "short_description": "My guest is Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of multiple books on effective leadership and teamwork, self-discipline and mindset, and host of the Jocko Podcast. We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how \u201cenergy\u201d actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity.  And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for \u2018detachment\u2019 as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.\n\n#HubermanLab #JockoWillink\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nJocko Willink\nExtreme Ownership book: https://amzn.to/3VtiUPw\nWay of the Warrior Kid book: https://amzn.to/3VwPIHC\nJocko Podcast: https://jockopodcast.com\nEchelon Front: https://echelonfront.com \nJocko's website: https://jocko.com \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jockowillink \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/jockowillink \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jkowillink\n\nBooks\nOn The Psychology of Military Incompetence: https://amzn.to/46PnpcR\nMastery: https://amzn.to/3RCRk3R\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Jocko Willink\n00:03:50 Maui Nui Venison, Eight Sleep, LMNT, Momentous\n00:08:42 Sense of Self, Discovery & Autonomy\n00:19:11 Mindsets in the Military: Garrison vs. Combat\n00:25:02 Military Divisions\n00:29:34 Daily Workouts & Discipline\n00:35:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:53 Energy & Movement, Cortisol, Nutrition\n00:52:10 Exercise & Energy, Deliberate Cold Exposure\n00:59:05 Win vs. Loss Mindset, Leadership, Action & Energy \n01:12:07 InsideTracker\n01:13:11 Confidence, Generators vs. Projectors, Family\n01:24:01 Restoring Motivation: Social Connection & Play\n01:32:44 Self-Identity & Context, Alcohol, Music, Dopamine\n01:45:10 Motivation Sources & Recovering from Loss\n01:54:05 Suicide, Navy SEALs, Social Contagion\n02:09:00 Suicide, Alcohol, Positive Action \n02:15:03 Meditation, Detachment\n02:20:30 Adaptability & Opportunities, Navy SEALs \n02:30:43 Ambition & Love, Likeability, Leadership\n02:40:18 Building Teams, Detachment, Family\n02:50:20 Detachment: Problems & Perspective\n02:55:55 Tools: Strategies to Detach from Situation\n03:08:31 Tool: Situational Awareness & Detachment\n03:17:49 Social Media, Personal Flaws\n03:23:01 Falling Asleep & Detachment\n03:27:02 Resilience Calibration, Navy SEAL Training & Combat\n03:39:16 Deliberate Discomfort & Mental Resilience\n03:42:21 People & Animals, Personalities\n03:51:25 Political Leadership & Military, Social Media\n04:01:38 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks\u2014thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine. Since caffeine is one of the most commonly used substances (more than 90% of adults use caffeine daily!), this episode provides actionable tips for adjusting caffeine consumption to positively impact performance and health, including sleep. \n\n#HubermanLab #Caffeine #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nAnti-diabetic effects of GLP1 analogs are mediated by thermogenic interleukin-6 signaling in adipocytes: https://bit.ly/3Vy58Mi\nCaffeine in Floral Nectar Enhances a Pollinator's Memory of Reward: https://bit.ly/3XZ7Yf9\nConsumption of caffeinated beverages and serum concentrations of sex steroid hormones in US men: https://bit.ly/3Y94kPZ\nInverse association between caffeine intake and depressive symptoms in US adults: data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006: https://bit.ly/3XVB7I1\nCaffeine stimulation of cortisol secretion across the waking hours in relation to caffeine intake levels: https://bit.ly/3iAS5eH\nTime course of tolerance to the performance benefits of caffeine: https://bit.ly/3F4kGjN\nCaffeine consumption and menstrual function: https://bit.ly/3F1pBlM\nErgogenic effects of caffeine on peak aerobic cycling power during the menstrual cycle: https://bit.ly/3B819xX\nConsolidating Memories: https://bit.ly/3UEudUQ\nBlood dopamine level enhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running: https://bit.ly/3HrqKpJ\nThe neuroprotective effects of caffeine in neurodegenerative diseases: https://bit.ly/3Ha3kER\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Caffeine\n00:02:58 Tool: GLP-1, Yerba Mate, Satiety & Weight Loss\n00:11:06 Levels, Eight Sleep, ROKA, Momentous Supplements\n00:15:23 Caffeine Benefits for Mental & Physical Performance\n00:20:23 Caffeine in Nature & Positive Reinforcement\n00:26:44 Caffeine Effects on Brain; Reward Pathways\n00:29:55 Caffeine as a Reinforcing Agent\n00:36:47 AG1 (Athletic Greens) \n00:38:01 Caffeine, Adenosine & Reduced Sleepiness \n00:45:16 Tool: Caffeine Dosage, Caffeine Adapted\n00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep\n01:04:46 Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects\n01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use \n01:13:00 Theanine: Effects & Dosage\n01:18:41 InsideTracker\n01:19:45 Other Effects: Osteoporosis, Hormone Levels, Depression\n01:27:41 Afternoon Caffeine & Sleep\n01:31:45 Tool: Caffeine & Mental/Physical Performance; Cortisol & Caffeine Abstinence\n01:46:04 Caffeine, Performance & Menstrual Cycle\n01:47:27 Tool: Memory & Caffeine Timing; Adrenaline & Cold Exposure\n01:54:08 Caffeine & Naps\n01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement \n02:01:55 Dopamine Stacking\n02:06:04 Scheduling Caffeine to Maximize Its Effects\n02:08:33 Pro-Health Effects of Caffeine\n02:13:38 Tool: Sugar Cravings & Reinforcing Effects of Caffeine \n02:20:17 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali, fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss, and prostate health, and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally. Dr. Gillett offers numerous actionable tools that can be tailored to specific goals and age ranges to attain and maintain optimal levels of male hormones for overall health, well-being and longevity. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Hormones \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Kyle Gillet\nDr. Gillett\u2019s clinic: https://gilletthealth.com \nGillet Health YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@gilletthealth6738\nThe Gillet Health Podcast on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3Bu13kh\nThe Gillet Health Podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3FJSCUz\nInstagram: https://www.Instagram.com/kylegillettmd\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gilletthealth \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Kyle Gillett & Male Hormone Optimization\n00:03:40 Thesis, ROKA, Helix Sleep, Momentous\n00:07:43 Puberty: Height, Resistance Training, Childhood Obesity\n00:15:14 \u201cFirst\u201d vs. \u201cSecond\u201d Puberty\n00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work\n00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones\n00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose\n00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication\n00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire\n00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & the Dopamine \u201cWave Pool\u201d\n00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen for Hormone Health\n00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)\n01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)\n01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone\n01:15:34 InsideTracker\n01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways\n01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone \n01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise \n01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens\n01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome\n01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy\n01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene\n01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature\n01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat\n02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)\n02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids\n02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health\n02:21:55 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

We discuss Lex\u2019s recent trip to the heart of the Ukrainian-Russian War, geopolitics, perspectives on people living in war zones, the shared human experience, and how information is communicated and controlled. As an experienced podcaster and public educator, Dr. Fridman offers unique insights into the art of holding conversations that grow understanding, especially when they involve people with opposing viewpoints. We also discuss the peer-review process for scientific research publications and how social media and podcasts are evolving the way science and technology are communicated. We consider how to find and follow your life\u2019s purpose, maintain ongoing motivation and implement support systems to build and sustain momentum. Our conversation also covers capitalism, masculinity, chess and cheating, Lex\u2019s idea for an AI robotics start-up and a Q&A from audience questions solicited on social media. As one of the main inspirations for the Huberman Lab podcast, hosting Dr. Fridman for this special centennial episode was an honor and a pleasure!\n\n#HubermanLab #LexFridman\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Lex Fridman\nWebsite: https://lexfridman.com \nPodcast: https://lexfridman.com/podcast \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Lex Fridman\n00:04:30 LMNT, Levels, Eight Sleep\n00:08:28 Podcasting\n00:12:11 Ukraine, Russia, War & Geopolitics\n00:23:17 Conflict & Generalized Hate\n00:26:23 Typical Day in Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars\n00:37:28 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:38:42 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Sauna; Fertility\n00:46:44 Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky\n00:53:33 Firearms; Violence & Sensitization\n00:57:40 MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic\n01:05:51 Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media\n01:13:05 InsideTracker\n01:14:17 Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity\n01:26:05 Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes\n01:35:11 Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status\n01:45:08 Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups\n01:53:50 Motivation & Competition; Relationships\n02:01:55 Jobs; A Career vs. A Calling; Robotics & Relationships\n02:12:11 Chess, Poker & Cheating\n02:22:25 Ideas of Lately\n02:24:44 Why Lex Wears a Suit & Tie\n02:27:50 Is There an AI Equivalent of Psychedelics? \n02:29:06 Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt to Achieve\n02:32:07 Advice to Young People\n02:39:29 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "My guest this episode is Chris Palmer, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer\u2019s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/Huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Chris Palmer\nDr. Palmer\u2019s website: https://www.chrispalmermd.com \nBrain Energy: A Revolutionary Breakthrough in Understanding Mental Health--and Improving Treatment for Anxiety, Depression, OCD, PTSD, and More: https://amzn.to/3XheFIV\nMedical profile: https://www.mcleanhospital.org/profile/christopher-palmer \nAcademic profile & publications: https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/70255\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChrisPalmerMD\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrispalmermd\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Chris Palmer, Mental Health & Metabolic Disorders\n00:03:25 Thesis, Eight Sleep, ROKA\n00:07:18 Nutrition & Mental Health\n00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis\n00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet\n00:34:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence\n00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits\n00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment\n00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health\n00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits for Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders\n01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health\n01:15:12 InsideTracker\n01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet\n01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose\n01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria\n01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana \n01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet\n01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease & Ketones\n02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet\n02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose \n02:10:16 Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet\n02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss\n02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep\n02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility\n02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications \n03:01:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

While it is difficult to standardize happiness from one person to the next, I outline a structured framework of what is critical to increasing your innate \u201cnatural happiness,\u201d including financial security, purposeful work and relationships, and I explain specific tools to increase internal happiness (so-called \u201csynthetic happiness\u201d). I review how specific types of human connection and attention to our choices (or lack thereof) can increase or undermine our level of happiness. I also discuss the importance of certain types of physical contact, gratitude, financial choices and volunteer contributions that research shows can maximize happiness. And I discuss how factors such as children, pets, physical well-being, substance use, prior traumas and life-phase milestones affect our quest for and depth of happiness.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAthletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nSpending Money on Others Promotes Happiness: http://bit.ly/3X3k71V\nA Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind: https://bit.ly/3sMP64B\nEye contact marks the rise and fall of shared attention in conversation: http://bit.ly/3hy04IF\nThe Influence of Interactions with Dogs on Affect, Anxiety, and Arousal in Children: http://bit.ly/3htjBdh\n\nBooks\nDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence: https://amzn.to/3A9S4UY\nThe Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity\u2015and Will Determine the Fate of the Human Race: https://amzn.to/3E3Und5\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Happiness\n00:06:27 Tool: Light Exposure Timing & Brightness Timing\n00:14:14 Thesis, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep\n00:17:51 Imprecise Language for Happiness\n00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters \n00:26:32 Harvard Happiness Project \n00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group \n00:37:20 Work, Sense of Meaning & Happiness\n00:40:13 Toolkit for General Wellbeing\n00:43:06 Happiness Across the Lifespan, Does Having Children Make Us Happier?\n00:47:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness\n00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness\n00:54:23 Trauma & Happiness, Lottery Winner vs. Paraplegic Accident\n01:05:05 Synthesizing Happiness\n01:09:18 Natural Happiness & Synthetic Happiness; Music\n01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude\n01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness\n01:31:55 Tool: Focus, Wandering Mind & Meditation \n01:39:40 Tool: Quality Social Connection\n01:41:28 Brief Social Connection, Facial Recognition & Predictability\n01:46:33 Deep Social Connection, Presence & Eye Contact\n01:54:00 Physical Contact & Social Connection, Allogrooming, Pets\n02:03:00 Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness\n02:11:57 Happiness Toolkit\n02:22:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

We discuss the science of energy utilization and balance, the efficacy of different diets (e.g., ketogenic, vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore), and how best to build lean muscle mass and lose fat. We also discuss optimal protein and fiber intake, the best sources of protein, the correlation between appetite, satiety signals and exercise, along with male and female-specific needs. Dr. Norton also explains how to support a healthy gut microbiome and offers insight into sugar and artificial sweeteners, processed, cooked, and raw foods, supplements, seed oils, and the relationship of LDL/HDL levels to cardiovascular health. This episode serves as a master class in nutrition, metabolism and exercise and is sure to benefit people of all ages and with different health and fitness goals.\n\n#HubermanLab #Nutrition #Exercise\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://www.drinklmnt.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Layne Norton\nBioLayne: https://biolayne.com \nCarbon app: https://joincarbon.com \nREPS (Research Explained in Practical Summaries): https://biolayne.com/reps\nBooks: https://biolaynestore.com/collections/accessories \n\nArticles\nRole of Nonexercise Activity Thermogenesis in Resistance to Fat Gain in Humans: https://bit.ly/3UwmmJ2\nA potent physiological method to magnify and sustain soleus oxidative metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation: https://bit.ly/3FLkLuZ\nCreatine Supplementation Increases Total Body Water Without Altering Fluid Distribution: https://bit.ly/3T9ki8M\nBiology's response to dieting: the impetus for weight regain: https://bit.ly/3UxwUIa\n\nOther Resources\nBioLayne \u2013 New Research Shows Artificial Sweeteners Mess Up Your Gut? https://youtu.be/6M6RP_YRgVg\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Layne Norton, Nutrition & Fitness \n00:02:53 LMNT, ROKA, InsideTracker, Momentous\n00:06:50 Calories & Cellular Energy Production \n00:12:35 Energy Balance, Food Labels, Fiber \n00:15:19 Resting Metabolic Rate, Thermic Effect of Food\n00:19:04 Exercise & Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) \n00:25:49 Losing Weight, Tracking Calories, Daily Weighing\n00:29:24 Post-Exercise Metabolic Rate, Appetite \n00:35:04 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:19 Exercise & Appetite, Calorie Trackers, Placebo Effects & Beliefs\n00:43:46 Exercise & Satiety Signals, Maintain Weight Loss & Identity\n00:56:32 Weight Loss & Maintenance, Diet Adherence \n01:03:33 Restrictive Diets & Transition Periods\n01:08:03 Gut Health & Appetite \n01:16:23 Tool: Supporting Gut Health, Fiber & Longevity\n01:23:59 LDL, HDL & Cardiovascular Disease\n01:30:31 Leucine, mTOR & Protein Synthesis\n01:37:31 Tool: Daily Protein Intake & Muscle Mass\n01:44:24 Protein & Fasting, Lean Body Mass\n01:55:38 Plant-Based Proteins: Whey, Soy, Leucine, Corn, Pea\n02:04:28 Processed Foods\n02:11:54 Obesity Epidemic, Calorie Intake & Energy Output\n02:17:33 Obesity, Sugar & Fiber, Restriction & Craving\n02:25:57 Artificial Sweeteners & Blood Sugar\n02:38:55 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome, Sucralose, Blood Sugar\n02:50:19 Rapid Weight Loss, Satiety & Beliefs\n02:58:13 Seed Oils & Obesity, Saturated Fat, Overall Energy Toxicity\n03:08:15 Females, Diet, Exercise & Menstrual Cycles\n03:14:05 Raw vs. Cooked Foods\n03:16:32 Berberine & Glucose Scavenging\n03:19:12 Fiber & Gastric Emptying Time\n03:21:00 Supplements, Creatine Monohydrate, Rhodiola Rosea\n03:30:33 Hard Training; Challenge & Mental Resilience\n03:36:12 Carbon App\n03:47:11 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the \u201cthird-eye center,\u201d what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.\n\n#HubermanLab #Meditation #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nA Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind: https://bit.ly/3sMP64B\nBrief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators: https://bit.ly/3zu83gf\nYoga nidra practice shows improvement in sleep in patients with chronic insomnia: A randomized controlled trial: https://bit.ly/3zvZwtb\n\nBooks\nWherever You Go, There You Are: https://amzn.to/3TSnOFF\nThe Harvard Psychedelic Club: https://amzn.to/3NkQ2qg\nAltered Traits: https://amzn.to/3wXsKj8\n\nOther Resources\nWaking Up app: https://www.wakingup.com\nNSDR (Virtusan / Huberman): https://youtu.be/AKGrmY8OSHM\nNSDR (Madefor): https://youtu.be/pL02HRFk2vo\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Meditation \n00:04:13 InsideTracker, Thesis, ROKA, Momentous Supplements\n00:08:25 Brief History of Meditation: Consciousness, Psychedelics, fMRI \n00:16:19 How the Brain Interprets the Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness \n00:26:07 Neuroscience of Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights\n00:32:27 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:33:41 Interoception vs. Exteroception\n00:42:20 Default Mode Network, Continuum of Interoception & Exteroception\n00:53:30 Tools: Interoceptive or Exteroceptive Bias, Meditation Challenge\n01:01:48 State & Trait Changes, Interoceptive & Exteroceptive Meditations, Refocusing \n01:07:35 Tool: Brief Meditations, Waking Up App\n01:10:30 \u201cThird Eye Center\u201d & Wandering Thoughts\n01:20:46 Meditation: Practice Types, Focal Points & Consistency \n01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception \n01:30:41 Tool: Meditation Breathwork, Cyclic vs. Complex Breathwork\n01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma\n01:47:43 Model of Interoception & Dissociation Continuum\n01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge \n02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) \n02:11:33 Choosing a Meditative Practice; Hypnosis\n02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB) \n02:25:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "My guest is Eddie Chang, MD, a neurosurgeon and professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the co-director of the Center for Neural Engineering & Prostheses. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying speech, language learning and comprehension, communicating human emotion with words and hand gestures, bilingualism and language disorders, such as stuttering. Dr. Chang also explains his work developing and applying state-of-the-art technology to decode speech and using that information and artificial intelligence (AI) to successfully restore communication to patients who have suffered paralyzing injuries or \u201clocked in syndrome.\u201d We also discuss his work treating patients with epilepsy. Finally, we consider the future: how modern neuroscience is overturning textbook medical books, the impact of digital technology such as smartphones on language and the future of natural and computer-assisted human communication. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://www.levelshealth.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Eddie Chang\nSupport research in the Chang Laboratory: https://changlab.ucsf.edu/support-our-work\nDr. Chang\u2019s lab: https://changlab.ucsf.edu \nAcademic profile & publications: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/edward.chang \nUCSF clinical profile: https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/dr-edward-chang \n\nArticles\nNeuroprosthesis for Decoding Speech in a Paralyzed Person with Anarthria: https://bit.ly/3sjv5Cx\n\nArticles in the News\nTapping Into the Brain to Help a Paralyzed Man Speak: https://nyti.ms/3f0AM5c\nHow Brain-Computer Interfaces Could Restore Speech and Help Fight Depression: https://on.wsj.com/3f1iBMH\nDecoded Brain Signals Could Give Voiceless People A Way To Talk: https://n.pr/3gujhdP\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Eddie Chang, Speech & Language \n00:03:00 Levels, Eight Sleep, InsideTracker, Momentous Supplements\n00:07:19 Neuroplasticity, Learning of Speech & Environmental Sounds\n00:13:10 White Noise Machines, Infant Sleep & Sensitization\n00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language in the Brain\n00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy \n00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery \n00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy\n00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Other Seizure Types\n00:41:08 Brain Areas for Speech & Language, Broca\u2019s & Wernicke\u2019s Areas, New Findings\n00:53:23 Lateralization of Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes\n00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits\n01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction from Ear to Brain\n01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations\n01:17:37 Mapping Language in the Brain\n01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages \n01:25:07 Motor Patterns of Speech & Language\n01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments\n01:34:47 Evolution of Language \n01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome\n01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory \n01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, \u201cLocked-In Syndrome\u201d & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)\n02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation\n02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars\n02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment \n02:22:55 Tools: Practices for Maintaining Calm Under Extreme Demands\n02:31:10 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams\u2019 work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams\u2019 knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Nolan Williams\nStanford Profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/nolan-williams\nBrain Stimulation Lab: https://bsl.stanford.edu\nPublications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i4WyrcYAAAAJ&hl=en\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nolanrywilliams\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nolan-williams-0802a324\n\nArticles\nAdjunctive triple chronotherapy (combined total sleep deprivation, sleep phase advance, and bright light therapy) rapidly improves mood and suicidality in suicidal depressed inpatients: An open label pilot study: https://bit.ly/3CJCWiv\nDevelopment of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse: https://bit.ly/3fJPjSI\n\nBooks\nBreaking Open the Head: https://amzn.to/3fVqbIG\n\nOther Resources\nBrain Stimulation Lab \u2013 Ongoing & Upcoming Studies: https://bsl.stanford.edu/clinical-trials\nMagnus Medical: https://www.magnusmed.com \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n00:03:31 Huberman Lab Premium \n00:04:42 InsideTracker, Eight Sleep, ROKA\n00:08:37 Momentous Supplements \n00:09:16 Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n00:15:11 The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n00:37:46 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:39:00 Belief/Identity \u201cRules\u201d, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia \n00:54:27 Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience or Biology?\n01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance or Circuit?\n01:13:58 Memories & \u201cRule\u201d Creation; Psilocybin & \u201cRule\u201d Resolution \n01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin & Depression Treatment\n01:24:12 Is MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin\n01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment\n01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: \u201cLetting Go\u201d & Depression Treatment\n01:41:23 Normal Spectrums for Mental Health Disorders\n01:45:35 Ibogaine & \u201cLife Review\u201d; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials\n01:57:16 Clinical Use of Psychedelics \n02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study\n02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses\n02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol\n02:20:42 Circadian Reset for Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light \n02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study\n02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation\n02:45:35 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

    "short_description": "My guest is David Anderson, PhD, a world expert in the science of sexual behavior, violent aggression, fear and other motivated states. Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about mental health, human emotions, sexual and/or violent behavior.  \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. David Anderson\nDr. David Anderson: https://davidandersonlab.caltech.edu/davidanderson \nThe Nature of the Beast: https://amzn.to/3qsrdOH\nDr. David Anderson\u2019s Lab: https://davidandersonlab.caltech.edu \nDr. Anderson\u2019s publications: https://bit.ly/3L5uGMl\n\nArticles\nTwo Different Forms of Arousal in Drosophila Are Oppositely Regulated by the Dopamine D1 Receptor Ortholog DopR via Distinct Neural Circuits: https://bit.ly/3Dmyh7b\n\nResources\nMouse switching from mating behavior to aggressive behaviors upon stimulation of VMH: https://youtu.be/AIlp69kfqjw?t=882 \nVMH stimulation causes mouse to display aggressive behaviors toward an inanimate object (e.g., glove): https://youtu.be/AIlp69kfqjw?t=689\nPicture of Periaqueductal Gray (PAG): https://neuroscientificallychallenged.com/posts/know-your-brain-periaqueductal-gray\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. David Anderson, Emotions & Aggression \n00:03:33 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:27 Levels, Helix Sleep, LMNT \n00:08:10 Emotions vs. States\n00:10:36 Dimensions of States: Persistence, Intensity & Generalization\n00:14:38 Arousal & Valence \n00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression in Mice, VMH\n00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory \n00:29:20 Evolution & Development of Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear\n00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures for States & Homeostasis\n00:38:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:39:46 Hydraulic Pressure & Aggression\n00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression\n00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone\n00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood\n00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors \n01:05:10 Neurobiology of Sexual Fetishes \n01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression\n01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior or Dominance?\n01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior\n01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear \n01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression \n01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve \n01:52:52 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health. This episode provides a modifiable \u201cfoundational\u201d template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment. \n\n#HubermanLab #Fitness #Exercise\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nA potent physiological method to magnify and sustain soleus oxidative metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation: https://bit.ly/3yKcinr\nSkeletal Muscle Hypertrophy with Concurrent Exercise Training: Contrary Evidence for an Interference Effect: https://bit.ly/3VquEDL\n\nBooks\nRelax into Stretch: Instant Flexibility Through Mastering Muscle Tension: https://amzn.to/2D22cR9\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Strength, Muscle Size & Endurance: https://bit.ly/3D2ifP5\nJeff Cavaliere: Optimize Your Exercise Program with Science-Based Tools: https://bit.ly/3ELv0Pe\nDr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity: https://bit.ly/3ggkB3K\nATHLEAN-X: https://athleanx.com\nATHLEAN-X Neck Training: https://youtu.be/wjiZaCJ6tCA\nAnna Skips: https://www.instagram.com/anna.skips\n10-minute Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol: https://youtu.be/AKGrmY8OSHM\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Foundational Protocol for Fitness\n00:03:35 Huberman Lab Premium\n00:04:35 Tool: Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups, Glucose Utilization & Metabolism\n00:14:42 InsideTracker, ROKA, Helix Sleep, Momentous Supplements\n00:18:53 Core Principles of Fitness & Modifiable Variables\n00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout\n00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy\n00:38:09 Key Principles of Resistance Training\n00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery\n00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training\n01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives\n01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate\n01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training\n01:27:30 Flexibility of Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing\n01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs \n01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts\n01:37:18 Tool: Stress or Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR\n01:40:04 Should You Train Fasted or Fed?\n01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training\n01:47:56 Tool: Hanging from a Bar & Fitness Metric \n01:49:02 Should You Train Sick?, Ramping Training\n01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery\n01:53:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one\u2019s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nInspired by Mary Jane?

I discuss nicotine\u2019s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.). As nicotine is one of the most widely used substances with billions of users \u2014 most of whom report wanting to quit \u2014 this episode ought to be of interest to former/current nicotine users, those who want to quit smoking or vaping and/or those interested in learning the biology behind how nicotine impacts the brain and body. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPredictors of smoking abstinence following a single-session restructuring intervention with self-hypnosis: https://bit.ly/3LoU0gA\nEffect of hypnotic suggestion on cognition and craving in smokers: https://bit.ly/3xtUwEn\nPharmacological Approach to Smoking Cessation: An Updated Review for Daily Clinical Practice: https://bit.ly/3eTkfiV\n\nResources\nReveri: https://www.reveri.com\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Nicotine \n00:02:47 Momentous Supplements \n00:03:41 Tool: Brief Daily Meditation & Focus \n00:05:59 The Arrow Model of Focus, Alpha GPC & Garlic Supplements\n00:10:43 Thesis, InsideTracker, ROKA \n00:14:35 Nicotine Effects vs. Methods of Delivery, Acetylcholine\n00:19:55 Where is Nicotine Found?

    "short_description": "My guest is Casey Halpern, M.D., Chief of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery and Professor of Neurosurgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Halpern\u2019s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions. This episode will interest those curious about the biology of eating, anorexia, bulimia, compulsive thoughts and behaviors, and movement. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Casey Halpern\nPenn Medicine Profile: https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/casey-halpern \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/halpernc \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-halpern-a1569749 \nResponsive Neurostimulation For Loss Of Control Eating (DBSLOC) Study: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03868670\n\nArticles\nPilot study of responsive nucleus accumbens deep brain stimulation for loss-of-control eating: https://go.nature.com/3Sc1ZA1\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Casey Halpern & Disordered Eating & Brain Stimulation\n00:03:18 ROKA, Eight Sleep, InsideTracker\n00:07:19 Momentous Supplements \n00:08:28 Neurosurgeon\u2019s View of the Brain, Neurosurgery Specialization \n00:13:05 Deep Brain Stimulation & Other Unexpected Positive Effects \n00:17:20 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies \n00:25:40 Brain Areas in OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction\n00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:32:27 Facial and Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition\n00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity \n00:47:18 Stimulation of Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation\n00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss of Control Eating\n00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress \n01:02:07 Electrodes in Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying \u201cCraving Cells\u201d\n01:11:41 Effects of Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation \n01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments for Anorexia\n01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\n01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson\u2019s\n01:36:40 Future of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression\n01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States in Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation\n01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions\n01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts \n01:59:00 \u201cNeurosurgeon Calm,\u201d Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training \n02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation\n02:11:59  Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I provide a list of behavioral, nutritional, and supplement-based tools you can use to improve your ability to get into a focused state to do mental or physical work. I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone. By the end, you\u2019ll have an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost focus and concentration strategies to select from that can be tailored to your physical and mental performance needs.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nVirtusan: https://virtusan.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nAcute Stress Improves Concentration Performance: https://bit.ly/3wVuJoh\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3ep6Z5x\nBrief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators: https://bit.ly/3ai0X4D\n\nBooks\nAltered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body: https://amzn.to/3wXsKj8\n\nResources\nHuberman Lab Toolkit for Sleep: https://hubermanlab.com/toolkit-for-sleep\nBrainWave (App Store): https://apple.co/3QavGzO\nBrain Waves (Google Play): https://bit.ly/3enO8HP\nWhite, Pink vs. Brown Noise: https://youtu.be/aiyh2j-BfkQ\nMadefor NSDR: https://youtu.be/pL02HRFk2vo\nReveri: https://www.reveri.com\nAnna Park Yerba Mate: https://amzn.to/3wzvfrV\nExamine: https://examine.com\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Focus Toolkit \n00:04:25 Momentous Supplements \n00:05:38 Thesis, LMNT, Eight Sleep \n00:09:37 The \u201cArrow Model\u201d of Focus: Epinephrine, Acetylcholine & Dopamine\n00:15:15 Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance of Sleep\n00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats to Improve Concentration \n00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition to Focused State\n00:22:55 Warm-Up for Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity \n00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing \n00:31:22 How Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform? \n00:34:14 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:35:35 Virtusan: Mental & Physical Health Journeys \n00:36:52 Tool: Fasted vs. Fed States & Focus, Prevent an Afternoon Crash, Ketosis\n00:45:52 Tool: Foods to Improve Focus & Regulating Food Volume\n00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness\n00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration \n00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine \n01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Your Own Protocols \n01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability to Refocus \n01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods\n01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States\n01:16:07 Optimal Time of Day to Use Specific Tools\n01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze \n01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work \n01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids \n01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate \n01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk of Stroke? & Garlic \n01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food\n01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability \n01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced Dosage\n01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency \n01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine\n01:44:50 Tool: Other Supplements to Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine \n01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools for Focus\n01:49:12 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

    "short_description": "My guest this episode is Dr. Erich Jarvis, PhD\u2014Professor and the Head of the Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Language at Rockefeller University and Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Dr. Jarvis' research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stutter/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone interested in the origins of human speech, language, music and culture and how newer technology, such as social media and texting, change our brains.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman  \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hu...\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Erich Jarvis\nDr. Erick Jarvis' Lab: https://www.jarvislab.net \nRockefeller University: https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/1159-erich-d-jarvis\nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cI-fi9MAAAAJ\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/erichjarvis\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/erich_d_jarvis\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/erich-jarvis-ba73624\n\nOther Resources:\nEarth Biogenome Project: https://www.earthbiogenome.org \nGenomeArk: https://vgp.github.io/genomeark\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Erich Jarvis & Vocal Communication\n00:03:43 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:36 InsideTracker, ROKA, LMNT \n00:08:01 Speech vs. Language, Is There a Difference?  \n00:10:55 Animal Communication, Hand Gestures & Language \n00:15:25 Vocalization & Innate Language, Evolution of Modern Language    \n00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders \n00:27:11 Innate Predisposition to Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization\n00:31:34 Genes for Speech & Language\n00:35:49 Learning New or Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes \n00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens) \n00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing\n00:47:32 Singing, Link Between Dancing & Vocal Learning \n00:52:55 Motor Theory of Vocal Learning, Dance \n00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions\n01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions\n01:09:35 Reading & Writing \n01:15:13 Writing by Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing\n01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations\n01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & the Future\n01:36:26 Movement: The Link to Cognitive Growth \n01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation\n01:48:24 Evolution of Skin & Fur Color\n01:51:22 Dr. Erich Jarvis, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss the physiological effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain and body at different levels of consumption and over time. I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior \u2013 hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nAssociations between alcohol consumption and gray and white matter volumes in the UK Biobank: https://go.nature.com/3PNFj7y\nGut Microbiota at the Intersection of Alcohol, Brain, and the Liver: https://bit.ly/3AaeF2F\nTolerance to alcohol: A critical yet understudied factor in alcohol addiction: https://bit.ly/3CmfCYo\nAssociations Between Drinking and Cortical Thickness in Younger Adult Drinkers: Findings From the Human Connectome Project: https://bit.ly/3AeUosJ\nModerate Alcohol Consumption and the Risk of Breast Cancer: https://bit.ly/3PHlJcK\nCan alcohol promote aromatization of androgens to estrogens?

    "short_description": "In this episode, I describe a comprehensive toolkit consisting of behavioral and supplement-based tools that you can customize to enhance the quality, duration and impact of your sleep. This has an enormous positive impact on your overall health and daytime functioning, brain, hormones and immune system. I teach you how to effectively harness light (and darkness), temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital devices in order to fall asleep faster, stay deeply asleep longer and overall, and achieve better quality sleep. I also describe how these tools can be modified to recover quickly from a poor night\u2019s sleep, jet lag or bouts of shift work. Given that sleep is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance, this episode should benefit everyone as it provides an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost strategies that can be tailored to optimize your sleep routine. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles: \nEarly evening light mitigates sleep compromising physiological and alerting responses to subsequent late evening light: https://go.nature.com/3zIAk1X\nRecommendations for daytime, evening, and nighttime indoor light exposure to best support physiology, sleep, and wakefulness in healthy adults: https://bit.ly/3bAwzTZ\nMeal Timing Regulates the Human Circadian System: https://bit.ly/3zECxLF\n\nBooks\nWhy We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams: https://amzn.to/3dfsncH\nBreath: The New Science of a Lost Art: https://amzn.to/3zEvF0P\n \nResources\nRing lights: https://amzn.to/3p2jDJD\nDrawing tablet: https://amzn.to/3bEbpVc\nLight Meter (Apple): https://apple.co/3P70ZLe\nLight Meter (Android): https://bit.ly/3P8N3Ax\nReveri: https://www.reveri.com\nMadefor NSDR: https://youtu.be/pL02HRFk2vo\nHuberman Lab Toolkit for Sleep: https://bit.ly/3Syq3hd\nHuberman Lab Podcast episode on shiftwork & jetlag.  : https://bit.ly/3SqX8LY\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Tools to Optimize Sleep \n00:03:02 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:16 InsideTracker, Eight Sleep, LMNT \n00:08:24 Factors to Control Circadian Rhythm & Sleep\n00:15:10 Morning Tool: Morning Sunlight Viewing, Cortisol \n00:20:44 Morning Sunlight: Circadian Rhythm, Artificial Lights, Cloudy Days \n00:26:18 Evaluating Light in Environment, Compensating for Missed Morning Light\n00:29:26 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:30:46 Morning Tools: Temperature & Deliberate Cold Exposure, Exercise\n00:34:58 Timing Caffeine, \u201cAfternoon Crash,\u201d Exercise\n00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm \n00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods \n00:46:49 Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise & Body Temperature, Caffeine \n00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight in Late Afternoon, Evening Light\n00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity \n01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment \n01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep\n01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine\n01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)\n01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety\n01:20:08 Falling Back Asleep: Reveri App, NSDR, Yoga Nidra \n01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet \n01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing \n01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine\n01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights\n01:37:38 Behavioral Tools for 3 Daily Critical Periods \n01:39:26 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Huberman Lab Clips, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I explain the biology, symptoms, causes and types of bipolar disorder (sometimes called bipolar depression). I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.\u2019 I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood. \n\n#HubermanLab #Bipolar #BipolarDisorder\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nBlinkist: https://www.blinkist.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nFull show notes & links to peer-reviewed articles: https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Bipolar Disorder \n00:02:23 Momentous Supplements \n00:03:42 Tool: Appetite Suppression & GLP-1, Parallel Pathways, Yerba Mate\n00:10:23 InsideTracker, ROKA, Blinkist\n00:14:24 Prevalence & Severity of Bipolar Disorder\n00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria of Mania \n00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability \n00:33:07 Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States\n00:38:20 Consequences of Bipolar Disorder, Heritability\n00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder\n00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts \n00:53:06 History of Lithium Treatment \n01:02:44 Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects\n01:05:05 Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection\n01:10:10 Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity\n01:17:11 Neural States & Mania, Parietal Lobe & Limbic System\n01:22:58 Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium & Ketamine\n01:36:00 Talk Therapies: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy \n01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) \n01:48:01 Psylocibin, Cannabis \n01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids \n02:03:31 Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity & Neuroplasticity \n02:06:44 Mania, Creativity & Occupations \n02:15:33 Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis, Neural Circuits & Treatment\n02:17:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Dr. Balcetis\u2019 research focuses on how our perception of the world, particularly our visual perceptions, influences our level and persistence of motivation, how we conceptualize goals, actual goal achievement, and our emotional state as we pursue goals. Dr. Balcetis explains how to best visualize and overcome challenges in pursuit of larger, complex goals. We also discuss the science of how to define goals and intermediate milestones, overcome obstacles, and effectively track progress. This episode highlights science-based, immediately actionable tools that anyone can use to set and achieve physical and/or cognitive goals more effectively. \n\n#HubermanLab #GoalSetting\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nLevels*: https://www.levelshealth.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \n\n*Edit to 6:07: Levels enables members to see their continuous glucose data alongside their food and exercise logs \u2014 Levels itself is not a continuous glucose monitor.\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nDr. Emily Balcetis\nNYU Profile: https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/emily-balcetis.html \nClearer, Closer, Better: How Successful People See The World: https://amzn.to/3PQfhBk \nWhy some people find exercise harder than others (TED Talk): https://bit.ly/3zHttqx \nDustin Grue: https://bit.ly/3vNFSqD\nWriter\u2019s bloc: An online, real-time communal writing platform for enhancing writing pedagogies: https://bit.ly/3SviY17\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/EBalcetis\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/emilybalcetis\n\nOther Resources:\nAnish Kapoor: https://anishkapoor.com \nReporter App: http://reporter-app.com \nOne Second Everyday App: https://1se.co\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Emily Balcetis, Visualization of Goals & Motivation \n00:03:24 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:38 Thesis, Levels, ROKA\n00:08:08 Vision & Motivation \n00:11:37 Tool: Narrowing Visual Focus & Improving Exercise \n00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue \n00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus \u201cSpotlight\u201d\n00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight to Increase Effort\n00:33:38 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists  \n00:41:28 Tool: How to Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles \n00:46:38 Vision is Unique, Challenging the Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-Goals\n00:57:12 Do Fit People View the World Differently?, States of Body & Visual Experiences\n01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation \n01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection\n01:21:54 Year in Review & Memory \n01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming \n01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution \n01:36:12 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Momentous Supplements\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Then, with that foundational understanding in mind, I describe a potent toolkit of science-supported behavioral, nutrition, and supplementation tools that can be used to increase baseline levels of individual neuromodulators and that can be modified for specific goals. This episode summarizes low-or-no-cost, actionable, science-based tools that can benefit anyone in order to enhance their levels of brain chemicals and improve mental health, physical health, and performance.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nRapid and reversible control of human metabolism by individual sleep states: https://bit.ly/3RofUmU\nResetting the late timing of \u2018night owls\u2019 has a positive impact on mental health and performance: https://bit.ly/3uD54Qd\nSkin exposure to UVB light induces a skin-brain-gonad axis and sexual behavior: https://bit.ly/3uGvOz5\nThe Role of Gene Encoding Variation of DRD4 in the Relationship between Inattention and Seasonal Daylight: https://bit.ly/3Ob154l\nCaffeine increases striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in the human brain: https://go.nature.com/3c6AQi4\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3IumXX1\nThe effect of Cissus quadrangularis (CQR-300) and a Cissus formulation (CORE) on obesity and obesity-induced oxidative stress: https://bit.ly/3AChHib\n\nOther Resources:\nThe Darya Rose Show: Sunscreen & Sunprotection with Dr. Brian Diffey: https://bit.ly/3IqHuf0\nHuberman Lab: Controlling Your Dopamine for Motivation Focus & Satisfaction: https://bit.ly/3IqQzVb\nHuberman Lab: ADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus: https://bit.ly/3uDo4Oo\nHuberman Lab: Using Deliberate Cold Exposure for Health & Performance: https://bit.ly/3AFfDGi\nHuberman Lab: Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety: https://bit.ly/3AzlRay\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Optimizing Neurochemicals to Improve Health \n00:03:40 Momentous Supplements\n00:04:30 Sleep & Maintaining Healthy Metabolism \n00:09:52 Tools: How to Wake Up Earlier, Night Owls\n00:19:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, InsideTracker\n00:22:05 Nervous System Overview \n00:31:32 How Neuromodulators Work  \n00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases \n00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators\n00:52:12 The 4 Major Types of Neuromodulators \n01:01:45 Tool Kit 1: Increase Baseline Dopamine & Focus \n01:08:52 Tyrosine-rich Foods & Dopamine \n01:10:59 Dopamine Supplementation: Mucuna Pruriens, L-tyrosine & Phenylethylamine\n01:16:00 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine \n01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips to Increase Dopamine \n01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness \n01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods \n01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine  \n01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior to Increase Focus & Acetylcholine\n01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior to Increase Serotonin & Feelings of Well-being  \n01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin\n01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol\n02:02:14 Use the Neurochemical Toolkit to Meet Individual Goals \n02:06:44 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments\u2014both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive \u201cthought-action loops\u201d and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nFull show notes & links to peer-reviewed articles: https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \n00:03:01 Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, Eight Sleep \n00:08:28 What is OCD and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?\n00:11:18 OCD: Major Incidence & Severity \n00:15:10 Categories of OCD\n00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions\n00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity \n00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms of OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops\n00:39:36 Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD \n00:46:39 Clinical OCD Diagnosis, Y-BOCS Index \n00:51:38 OCD & Fear, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) & Exposure Therapy \n01:01:56 Unique Characteristics of CBT/Exposure Therapy in OCD Treatment \n01:10:18 CBT/Exposure Therapy & Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) \n01:22:30 Considerations with SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments\n01:25:17 Serotonin & Cognitive Flexibility, Psilocybin Studies\n01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators \n01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD \n01:39:29 Ketamine Treatment \n01:41:43 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) \n01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus \n01:47:50 Thoughts Are Not Actions \n01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA \n02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD\n02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine \n02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder \n02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions \n02:31:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Dr. Zuker is the world\u2019s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste,  the \u201cgut-brain axis,\u201d the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.\n\n#HubermanLab #Sugar #Taste \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nDr. Charles Zuker\nColumbia Zuckerman Institute: https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/charles-s-zuker-phd \nLab website: https://www.zukerlab.com \nHoward Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) profile: https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/charles-s-zuker \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Charles Zuker & Taste Perception \n00:03:05 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:35 Thesis, ROKA, Helix Sleep\n00:08:35 Sensory Detection vs. Sensory Perception \n00:11:48 Individual Variations within Perception, Color\n00:16:20 Perceptions & Behaviors \n00:20:19 The 5 Taste Modalities \n00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste \n00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons for Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor\n00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception \n00:34:02 Tongue \u201cTaste Map,\u201d Taste Buds & Taste Receptors  \n00:39:34 Burning Your Tongue & Perception\n00:42:54 The \u201cMeaning\u201d of Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence \n00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior \n00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion  \n01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes over One\u2019s Lifetime\n01:09:14 Integration of Odor & Taste, Influence on Behavior & Emotion \n01:17:26 Sensitization to Taste, Internal State Modulation, Salt\n01:24:05 Taste & Saliva: The Absence of Taste\n01:28:10 Sugar & Reward Pleasure Centers; Gut-Brain Axis, Anticipatory Response\n01:36:23 Vagus Nerve\n01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis \n01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite \n01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis  \n01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes in Behavior \n02:01:53 Fast vs. Slow Signaling & Reinforcement, Highly Processed Foods  \n02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context\n02:15:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors, and science, to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called \u201cThe Ido Portal Method.\u201d Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns, and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also discuss learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skills- cognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought out teachers of movement alive today, the knowledge Ido shares in this conversation can benefit everyone\u2014children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians and trainers and the everyday person.\n\n#HubermanLab #IdoPortal #Movement \n\nWatch Ido Portal lead Andrew through his movement practice: https://youtu.be/JMzThWHk4CQ\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nIdo Portal Links\nWebsite: https://www.idoportal.com \nBlog: https://www.idoportal.com/blog \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/portal.ido \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/portaldo \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/portal.ido \n\nArticle Links\nThe Role of Variability in Motor Learning: https://bit.ly/3zOafQp\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Ido Portal, Movement & Movement Practice \n00:03:30 AG1 (Athletic Greens), ROKA, Helix Sleep \n00:07:49 What is Movement? \n00:10:56 Movement & the Body-Mind Connection\n00:14:47 Entry Points to Movement\n00:18:08 Early Education in Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination \n00:21:19 Stillness, Movement & the Environment, Playfulness  \n00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types of Movement, Contents vs. Containers \n00:40:50 Discomfort: Marker of Movement, Failures & Learning \n00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution  \n00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change \n01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution  \n01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement as Language, Consilience \n01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise  \n01:26:36 Potential for Movement, \u201cHumming\u201d \n01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees of Freedom \n01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity \n01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness  \n01:48:28 Hearing & Movement\n01:52:43 Walking Gaits\n01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness \n02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity to Others, Play & Discomfort \n02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback \n02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination \n02:31:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I explain the science behind limb range of motion and flexibility and how to increase them by using science-supported protocols. Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and \u201cmicro-stretching\u201d protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more. All people, physically active or not, should benefit from the information and tools described in this episode.\n\n#HubermanLab #Flexibility #Stretching\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nArticles\nForce enhancement after stretch of isolated myofibrils is increased by sarcomere length non-uniformities: https://go.nature.com/3tyUfxT\nMicrofluidic perfusion shows intersarcomere dynamics within single skeletal muscle myofibrils: https://bit.ly/3MLJWNV\nThe Effect of Time and Frequency of Static Stretching on Flexibility of the Hamstring Muscles: https://bit.ly/3aKIDRN\nThe Relation Between Stretching Typology and Stretching Duration: The Effects on Range of Motion: https://bit.ly/3aXtpcw\nA Comparison of Two Stretching Modalities on Lower-Limb Range of Motion Measurements in Recreational Dancers: https://bit.ly/3Hkpy5q\nStretching Reduces Tumor Growth in a Mouse Breast Cancer Model: https://go.nature.com/3xLQY0U\nInsular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance in Yoga Practitioners: https://bit.ly/39pLIXd\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Flexibility & Stretching \n00:02:57 Thesis, InsideTracker, Eight Sleep \n00:07:22 Innate Flexibility \n00:09:23 Movement: Nervous System, Connective Tissue & Muscle; Range of Motion\n00:17:51 Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms\n00:20:20 Decreased Flexibility & Aging\n00:22:38 Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice\n00:30:02 von Economo Neurons, Parasympathetic Activation & Relaxation \n00:42:00 Muscle Anatomy & Cellular \u2018Lengthening,\u2019 Range of Motion \n00:47:16 Tool: Protocol - Antagonistic Muscles, Pushing vs. Pulling Exercises \n00:51:57 Types of Stretching: Dynamic, Ballistic, Static & PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation)\n00:59:36 Tool: Increasing Range of Motion, Static Stretching Protocol, Duration\n01:05:56 Tool: Static Stretching Protocol & Frequency\n01:13:55 Tool: Effective Stretching Protocol\n01:17:12 Tool: Warming Up & Stretching\n01:19:17 Limb Range of Motion & General Health Benefits\n01:25:30 PNF Stretching, Golgi Tendon Organs & Autogenic Inhibition\n01:31:23 Tool: Anderson Protocol & End Range of Motion, Feeling the Stretch \n01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, \u201cMicro-Stretching\u201d  \n01:41:33 Tool: Should you Stretch Before or After Other Exercises?\n01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease \n01:51:37 Insula & Discomfort, Pain Tolerance & Yoga \n02:00:36 Tools: Summary of Stretching Protocols \n02:03:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Dr. Conti earned his MD at Stanford and did his residency at Harvard Medical School. He now runs the Pacific Premiere Group\u2014a clinical practice helping people heal and grow from trauma and other life challenges. We discuss trauma: what it is and its far-reaching effects on the mind and body, as well as the best treatment approaches for trauma. We also explore how to choose a therapist and how to get the most out of therapy, as well as how to do self-directed therapy.

    "short_description": "This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.\n\nWe recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.\n\n#HubermanLab #Grief\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\n\nArticles\nCraving love?

We discuss the role of cardiovascular exercise, weight training, deliberate cold exposure, meditation, verbal affirmations, sleep, and other behavioral practices for enhancing learning, mood and stress management, and increasing attention span. Dr. Suzuki shares the mechanisms by which these practices change our brain in order to improve cognitive function fast and reduce age-related cognitive decline. \n\n#HubermanLab #Memory\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nBlinkist: https://www.blinkist.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nWendy Suzuki Links\nAcademic Profile: https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/wendy-suzuki.html\nWebsite: https://www.wendysuzuki.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/wasuzuki \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wendy.suzuki  \nGood Anxiety (book): https://amzn.to/38bnoI4 \nHealthy Brain, Happy Life (book): https://amzn.to/3LD6tMj \nThe brain-changing benefits of exercise (TED Talk): https://youtu.be/BHY0FxzoKZE\n\nArticle Links\nNeurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus: https://go.nature.com/3LE75Bb\nAcute Exercise Improves Prefrontal Cortex but not Hippocampal Function in Healthy Adults: https://bit.ly/38JUCOP\nMidlife cardiovascular fitness and dementia: A 44-year longitudinal population study in women: https://bit.ly/3sSItOG\nBrief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators: https://bit.ly/3ai0X4D\n\nBook Links\nTiny Habits: The Small Changes that Change Everything: https://amzn.to/39LDmZF\nAtomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones: https://amzn.to/3NreMMr\nChatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It: https://amzn.to/3ahSLkX\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Wendy Suzuki, Learning & Memory\n00:02:50 AG1 (Athletic Greens), InsideTracker, Blinkist  \n00:07:27 How Memories Form \n00:10:14 Hippocampus: Memory, Association & Imagination \n00:16:20 Encoding Long-Term Memory \n00:18:48 One-Trial Memory\n00:21:56 Tool: Foundational Habits to Enhance Brain Performance \n00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making a \u201cBig, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus\u201d \n00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) \n00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) in Adults\n00:51:50 Effects of Exercise on Memory \n00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol \n01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise \n01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol for Improving Cognition \n01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors  \n01:17:09 \u201cEvery Drop of Sweat Counts\u201d \u2013 Exercise & Cognitive Function \n01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood \n01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance \n01:32:27 How Meditation Works, Focusing on the Present\n01:37:14 Tool: Strategies to Increase Attention \n01:42:50 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I also describe tools that can be used to modulate the factors that have been shown to \u2018prime\u2019 an individual for aggression, including sunlight, estrogen sensitivity, competition within social settings, and overall stress levels, and the hormone cortisol. I discuss how substances such as caffeine and alcohol can impact impulsive behaviors and how nutrition and supplementation can be used to regulate mood and aggression. \n\n#HubermanLab \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code: huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3DbFdlv\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/34Xod5H\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3wo01EJ\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nArticle Links\nPhotoperiod reverses the effects of estrogens on male aggression via genomic and nongenomic pathways: https://bit.ly/3sl6ehZ\nTestosterone and occupational choice: actors, ministers, and other men: https://bit.ly/3KV2IkS\nAge, Testosterone, and Behavior Among Female Prison Inmates: https://bit.ly/3N48xOt\nTestosterone Rapidly Increases Neural Reactivity to Threat in Healthy Men: A Novel Two-Step Pharmacological Challenge Paradigm: https://bit.ly/3MVP4iQ\nCaffeinated and non-caffeinated alcohol use and indirect aggression: The impact of self-regulation: https://bit.ly/39F09X3\nEfficacy of carnitine in the treatment of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: https://bit.ly/3FtpSh9\nFunctional identification of an aggression locus in the mouse hypothalamus (See \"Supplementary information\" for movies): https://go.nature.com/3yltYGB\n\nBook Links\nAn Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology 5th Edition: https://amzn.to/396bHm9\nThe Nature of the Beast: How Emotions Guide Us: https://amzn.to/3wd6NM3\n\nOther Links\nMouse switching from mating behavior to aggressive behaviors upon stimulation of VMH: https://youtu.be/AIlp69kfqjw?t=882\nVMH stimulation causes mouse to display aggressive behaviors toward an inanimate object (e.g., glove): https://youtu.be/AIlp69kfqjw?t=689\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Aggression, Types of Aggression \n00:03:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens), ROKA, Helix Sleep\n00:08:29 Neural Circuits for Aggression, \u201cHydraulic Pressure Model\u201d \n00:15:50 Brain Regions Controlling Aggression, Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH) \n00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression \n00:23:36 Stimulation of the VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression\n00:31:57 Neural Circuits Mediating Physical Acts of Aggression, Biting\n00:35:56 Testosterone & Competitiveness/Estrogen & Aggression \n00:43:00 Sunlight, Melatonin & Aggression \n00:45:46 Cortisol, Serotonin & Aggressive Behaviors \n00:51:56 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation & Mood \n00:54:18 Tool: Sunlight, Sauna & Cortisol Reduction\n00:55:54 Tool: Ashwagandha & Cortisol Reduction\n00:57:06 Tool: Seasonality/Sunlight, Genetic Variation in Estrogen Sensitivity\n01:00:37 Testosterone & Aggression, Competitive Work Environments\n01:05:07 Testosterone, Amygdala, Challenge & Effort \n01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity \n01:13:15 Tool: Caffeinated Alcohol Beverages, Impulsivity & Aggression \n01:17:18 Tool: ADHD, Acetyl-L Carnitine & Aggressive Behavior \n01:24:10 Factors Affecting the \u201cHydraulic Pressure Model\u201d of Aggression \n01:25:44 Book by Dr. David Anderson, Aggression & Social Relationships \n01:27:35 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I describe multiple science-based protocols to do this, including repetition, caffeine, emotional states, deliberate cold exposure, sleep, meditation, and the role of vision, including taking \u201cmental snapshots.\u201d I also describe how exercise and an associated hormone, osteocalcin, can improve cognitive ability and memory formation. I also describe unique aspects and forms of memory such as photographic memory, extreme facial recognition (aka super recognition), and the phenomenon known as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \n\n#HubermanLab #Memory\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3DbFdlv\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/34Xod5H\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3wo01EJ\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nArticle Links\nA Novel Demonstration of Enhanced Memory Associated with Emotional Arousal: https://bit.ly/3FLuyPH\nMechanisms of memory under stress: https://bit.ly/3sEmdaZ\nPhotographic Memory: The Effects of Volitional Photo Taking on Memory for Visual and Auditory Aspects of an Experience: https://bit.ly/3MlZB6U\nBrief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators: https://bit.ly/3PnYaH5\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Memory, Improving Memory  \n00:02:45 Eight Sleep, Thesis, InsideTracker \n00:07:54 Sensory Stimuli, Nervous System & Encoding Memory \n00:11:12 Context & Memory Formation \n00:13:46 Tool: Repetition, Improving Learning & Memory \n00:17:11 Co-Activation and intensity Neuron Activation  \n00:20:50 Different Types of Memory\n00:25:40 Memory Formation in the Brain, Hippocampus \n00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role in Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory\n00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement \n00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory\n00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline \n00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol  \n00:49:35 Accelerating the Repetition Curve & Adrenaline \n00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant Timing\n01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)\n01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline\n01:08:42 Timing of Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation \n01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact on Learning & Memory \n01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked with Learning: Not a New Principle \n01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization of Memories\n01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis \n01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function\n01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability \n01:34:41 Tool: Timing of Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement\n01:37:29 Photographic Memory\n01:38:49 \u201cSuper Recognizers,\u201d Facial Recognition   \n01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement\n01:49:12 D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\n01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing of Meditation\n02:02:21 How to Enhance Memory \n02:05:51 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

We discuss the four major categories of micronutrients that regulate cellular and organ stress and antioxidants, inflammation, hormone regulation, immune system, and longevity. Dr. Patrick provides actionable protocols for obtaining key micronutrients from food and/or supplement-based sources. Additionally, Dr. Patrick outlines protocols for deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure to benefit metabolism, cardiorespiratory fitness, mental health, and lifespan.\n\n#HubermanLab #Longevity\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Rhonda Patrick Links\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/foundmyfitness\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/foundmyfitness\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/foundmyfitness\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/FoundMyFitness\n\nArticle Links\nVitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids control serotonin synthesis and action, part 2: relevance for ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior: https://bit.ly/37XbqBF\nRole of phosphatidylcholine-DHA in preventing APOE4-associated Alzheimer's disease: https://bit.ly/3wfwDPB\nSkin exposure to UVB light induces a skin-brain-gonad axis and sexual behavior: https://bit.ly/3OP5Tha\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3F1ZwCN\nSauna use as a lifestyle practice to extend healthspan: https://bit.ly/3OKdRbv\n\nOther Links\nNRF2 Pathway, Moringa & Sulforaphane Supplementation: https://youtu.be/Q0lBVCpq8jc\nInternational Fish Oil Standards: https://bit.ly/3vzqoXI\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Rhonda Patrick \u2013 Micronutrients, Cold & Heat Exposure \n00:03:12 Momentous Supplements\n00:04:27 The Brain-Body Contract \n00:05:30 AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, InsideTracker\n00:09:42 Stress Response Pathways, Hormesis\n00:16:38 Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane\n00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed \n00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response\n00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination) \n00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges \n00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2 \n00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation \n00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression \n00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements? \n00:54:23 Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy \n00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources of EPA Omega-3s \n01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing\n01:10:22 Benefits of Omega-3s \n01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources of DHA Omega-3s\n01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure \n01:22:18 Role of Vitamin D, Gene Regulation \n01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation \n01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D \n01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity \n01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen\n01:40:30 Role of Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables\n01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate \n01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety\n01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation\n02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat \u2018Browning\u2019, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism\n02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle \n02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna \n02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood \n02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory\n02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer\u2019s and Dementia Risk \n02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) \n02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity \n02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility \n02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin \n02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna?

I detail specific protocols to safely engage in deliberate cold exposure, including minimal exposure times, time-of-day effects, determining optimal temperatures, recovery, mindset, and movement during cold exposure. I discuss how cold exposure can be used to safely stress the body to improve attention, mood, and cognitive focus and boost metabolism and reduce inflammation. Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.  \n\n#HubermanLab #ColdExposure #IceBaths\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com - use code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nTuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA\nWednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast:\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3DbFdlv\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/34Xod5H\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3wo01EJ\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nArticle Links\nBrief aerobic exercise immediately enhances visual attentional control and perceptual speed.

    "short_description": "I discuss the role of salt (sodium) in the nervous system and the key role that it plays in mental performance, physical performance and health. I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual\u2019s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates \u2018hidden\u2019 sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt\u2019s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body\u2019s performance.\n\n#HubermanLab #Hydration #Salt\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nTuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA\nWednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticle Links\n\"The preference for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sensor cell\": https://go.nature.com/33X9zuA\n\"Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Risk of Cardiovascular Events\": https://bit.ly/3MOJEGW\n\"Dietary sodium and health: How much is too much for those with orthostatic disorders?\": https://bit.ly/3tSP7UO\n\"Increased salt consumption induces body water conservation and decreases fluid intake\": https://bit.ly/35PCPVg\n\nBook Links\n\"The Salt Fix: Why the Experts Got It All Wrong--and How Eating More Might Save Your Life\": https://amzn.to/3CD1KHi\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Role of Salt  \n00:02:18 The Brain-Body Contract \n00:02:57 Neuropod Cells, Artificial Sweeteners & \u2018Hidden\u2019 Cravings \n00:10:57 AG1 (Athletic Greens), LMNT, InsideTracker \n00:15:06 Salt Regulation \n00:17:13 How the Brain Senses Salt\n00:24:15 Salt & Thirst  \n00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst \n00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation\n00:39:08 Vasopressin: Roles in Libido & Urination \n00:45:46 How Much Salt Do You Need? \n00:56:45 Should You Increase Your Salt Intake? \n01:02:19 Tools: Determining Your Individual Salt Intake\n01:14:02 Iodine, Sea Salt \n01:17:13 Salt: Roles in Stress & Anxiety \n01:24:20 Other Electrolytes: Magnesium & Potassium \n01:27:57 Tools: Effects of Low-carbohydrate Diets & Caffeine \n01:32:28 General Recommendations for Salt Intake  \n01:36:34 Perception of Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods \n01:47:13 Role of Sodium in Neuronal Function, Action Potentials \n01:53:13 Dehydration \n01:55:36 What Salt Intake is Best for You? \n02:00:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "My guest this episode is Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Professor of Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford University. Dr. Sonnenburg\u2019s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Microbiome #GutHealth \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nTuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA\nWednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour - code: \u2018huberman\u2019 \nPre-sale tickets go on sale on Tuesday, March 8th at 10 AM PT \n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Justin Sonnenburg Links:\nCenter for Microbiome Studies: https://stanford.io/3vGkdS0 \nDr. Sonnenburg\u2019s Lab: https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu \nDr. Sonnenburg\u2019s Published Work: https://stanford.io/3HN6eMF\n\nArticle Links:\n\"Gut-microbiota-targeted diets modulate human immune status\": https://bit.ly/3sLv2QI\n\nBook Links:\n\"The Good Gut: Taking Control of Your Weight, Your Mood, and Your Long-Term Health\": https://amzn.to/35RQP0c\n\"The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything and Living the Good Life\": https://amzn.to/3hqxkP0\n\nOther Links:\nNIH Human Microbiome Project: https://hmpdacc.org \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Gut Microbiome \n00:02:55 The Brain Body Contract   \n00:04:16 AG1 (Athletic Greens), ROKA, Helix Sleep \n00:08:30 What is the Gut Microbiome?\n00:12:49 Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability \n00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets\n00:21:56 The Human Microbiome Project at Stanford\n00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations\n00:28:58 Resilience of the Microbiome\n00:35:10 Regional Differences Along Your GI Tract \n00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health\n00:51:19 Dietary Differences \n01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods \n01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners \n01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful?

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss the profound effect the gut has on the nervous system. I cover the structure and function of the gut-brain axis and the role of the gut microbiome in the brain and overall health. I describe how the gut controls hunger or satiety by affecting neurons in our brain. I also contrast the many pathways by which the gut influences the brain: direct vs. indirect pathways, chemical vs. mechanical, and fast vs. slow signaling. Additionally, I discuss what defines a healthy microbiome and how your lifestyle impacts the gut microbiome, including the effects of stress, fasting, antibiotics, pets, environment, prebiotics and probiotics. I address how different foods shape the gut microbiome, in particular, the emerging data that fermented foods can increase the diversity of healthy gut microbiota.  Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed and textbook findings that reveal the critical role of the gut microbiome in supporting mental and physical health and I outline simple tools that anyone can use in order to enhance their gut microbiome health.\n\n#HubermanLab #GutHealth #Microbiome\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticle Links\n\"The Emerging Biology of Gut-Brain Sensory Transduction\": https://bit.ly/3HruBiE\n\"Mechanisms Underlying Microbial-Mediated Changes in Social Behavior in Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder\": https://bit.ly/3hmq5Y2\n\"Association of Loneliness and Wisdom With Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition: An Exploratory Study\": https://bit.ly/3spfYs2\n\"Emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype\": https://go.nature.com/3tcLKYp\n\"Brain fogginess, gas and bloating: a link between SIBO, probiotics and metabolic acidosis\": https://bit.ly/33YlsR9\n\"Gut-microbiota-targeted diets modulate human immune status\": https://bit.ly/3vlkQQD\n\"The preference for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sensor cell\": https://go.nature.com/33X9zuA\n\nBook Links\n\"The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything and Living the Good Life\": https://amzn.to/3hqxkP0\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Gut Microbiome  \n00:03:02 AG1 (Athletic Greens), LMNT, InsideTracker \n00:06:55 Your Gut-Brain Axis \n00:09:44 Gut-Brain Anatomy\n00:15:32 Microbiota vs. Gut Microbiome \n00:20:01 Roles of Gut Microbiome \n00:23:03 Neuropod Cells: (Subconscious) Tasting with Your Stomach \n00:34:13 Ghrelin: Slow Modulation of Your Brain in Hunger\n00:38:02 Glucagon Like Peptide 1; GLP-1 \n00:42:22 Tools: \u2018Free Will\u2019 & Food Cravings \n00:44:46 Mechanical Cues from Gut to Brain\n00:49:05 Dopamines, Vomiting \n00:52:06 Indirect Signals from Gut Microbiota\n00:59:30 Gut Microbiome \u201cCritical Periods\u201d  \n01:03:08 How Gut Health Controls Overall Health \n01:12:25 What is a Healthy Gut Microbiome?\n01:15:00 Tools: Enhance Your Gut Microbiome\n01:23:49 Foods to Enhance Microbiota Diversity; Fermented Foods \n01:37:07 High-Fiber Diets & Inflammation\n01:40:58 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners \n01:44:27 Structure & Function of Gut-Brain Axis \n01:49:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Dr. Spiegel has more than 40 years of clinical and research experience with hypnosis, stress physiology, and psychotherapy. In this episode, we examine the role of clinical hypnosis for the treatment of trauma, chronic pain, anxiety and more. Dr. Spiegel explains how to determine your level of \u2018hypnotizability\u2019 and provides case studies of incredible successes with hypnosis to treat a variety of ailments. We also discuss how breathing, vision and directed mental focus can modulate internal states and enhance performance. Additionally, we discuss how the adoption of self-hypnosis techniques can reduce stress and enhance sleep in anyone. Dr. Spiegel teaches us how hypnosis works at the neural circuit level to enhance cognitive flexibility. Throughout the episode, Dr. Spiegel summarizes key clinical trials and peer-reviewed findings and resources to work with a trained clinical professional or to do guided self-hypnosis.  \n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Hypnosis \n\nWatch Andrew\u2019s Hypnosis Session with Dr. Spiegel: https://youtu.be/tlTzVB6TGT0\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nROKA -  https://roka.com - code \"huberman\"\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. David Spiegel Links:\nStanford Center for Stress and Health: https://stresshealthcenter.stanford.edu\nSupport Dr. Spiegel\u2019s Research at Stanford (tax-deductible): https://stan.md/3p36Yqd\nDr. Spiegel\u2019s Published Work: https://stanford.io/3GYzL5C\nEmail: david@reveri.com\n\nArticle Links:\nPosthypnotic Amnesia in Hypnotizability Assessment: Validation of a New Scoring System for the Hypnotic Induction Profile: https://bit.ly/3uYrlsC\nPost-traumatic stress disorder and cancer: https://bit.ly/3h36vzX\nAssociation between Anterior Cingulate Neurochemical Concentration and Individual Differences in Hypnotizability: https://bit.ly/33BvMyj\nHypnosis reduces distress and duration of an invasive medical procedure for children: https://bit.ly/3p3wOuf\n\nOther Links:\nSociety for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis: https://www.sceh.us\nAmerican Society for Clinical Hypnosis: https://bit.ly/3JHU88Y\nWatch Andrew\u2019s Hypnosis Session with Dr. Spiegel: https://youtu.be/tlTzVB6TGT0\nReveri website: https://www.reveri.com \nReveri app (iOS): https://apple.co/3sT5RL8\nJoin the Waitlist for Reveri for Android: https://bit.ly/3JB2wa0\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. David Spiegel MD, Hypnosis  \n00:04:16 AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, ROKA\n00:09:09 Clinical Hypnosis\n00:16:45 Stage Hypnosis \n00:20:25 Neurobiology of Hypnosis\n00:26:04 ADHD\n00:28:22 Hypnosis for Stress & Sleep \n00:32:12 Hypnosis to Strengthen Neural Connections \n00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives\n00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy\n00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri \n00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions  \n01:01:50 \u2018Hypnotizability\u2019, the Spiegel Eye-roll Test  \n01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)\n01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma\n01:27:56 The Mind-Body Connection \n01:31:35 Dealing with Grief \n01:35:45 Hypnosis in Children & Groups\n01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis\n01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance \n01:50:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne, Instagram, Twitter \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I explain the role of play in childhood, as well as adulthood in skill and social development and describe key characteristics of the mind and body during play. Additionally, I explore how play allows the brain to test contingencies in different roles/environments. Throughout, I discuss the underlying neurobiology of play. I also describe how low-stakes play, and tinkering can broaden and shape your future capabilities. Finally, I discuss how our childhood \u2018personal play identity\u2019 informs our adult personality. Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Play\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAG1 (Athletic Greens) - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticle Links\nReading on a smartphone affects sigh generation, brain activity, and comprehension - https://go.nature.com/3rycDqe\nIn search of the neurobiological substrates for social playfulness in mammalian brains - https://bit.ly/3rvDvXP\nIs chess just a game, or is it a mirror that reflects the child's inner world? - https://bit.ly/3gsUNyr\nA new structural model for the study of adult playfulness: Assessment and exploration of an understudied individual differences variable - https://bit.ly/3otwvIU\n5MinuteConsult Journal Club - https://bit.ly/3sf7H8w\n\nBook Links\nPersonal play identity and the fundamental elements in its development process - https://bit.ly/331oYtm\nSpark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain - https://amzn.to/3uLnC1B\nPlay It Away: A Workaholic\u2019s Cure for Anxiety - https://amzn.to/3AZFUgx\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 The Power of Play \n00:02:23 Tool: Reading on Smart Phones, Sighing & Learning  \n00:09:14 AG1 (Athletic Greens), Roka, Helix Sleep \n00:13:57 Homeostatic Regulation of Play\n00:23:53 Childhood Play & Mindsets\n00:29:21 Contingency Testing  \n00:32:17 The (Power of) Playful Mindset\n00:36:13 Body Postures \n00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking \n00:48:24 Role Play\n00:50:39 Neurobiology of Low-stakes Play\n00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities through Tinkering \n01:00:03 Play Is THE Portal to Neuroplasticity \n01:04:44 Adulthood Play\n01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together \n01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery\n01:23:25 Competition & Dynamic Movement\n01:27:36 Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty  \n01:32:52 Personal Play Identity \n01:37:24 Play Transforms Your Future Self  \n01:40:55 Recommendations for Play\n01:44:25 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify/Apple Reviews, YouTube, Sponsors, Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss the science of setting, assessing, and pursuing goals. I explain the neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit. This episode ought to be useful for anyone seeking to improve their performance in work, school, exercise, athletics, or personal development.\n\n#HubermanLab #Goals #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nLMNT - https://www.drinkLMNT.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nThe 85% Rule for Optimal Learning - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4 \nEffects of Narrowing Visual Attention on Goal Pursuit Behavior - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167219861438 \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 The Neuroscience of Goals\n00:01:56 Tool 1: Learn Fast(er) by the 85% Rule \n00:06:04 LMNT, Athletic Greens, ROKA\n00:13:55 Brain Circuits for Setting & Pursuing Goals\n00:21:52 Determining the Value of Goals \n00:24:33 Psychology of Goal Setting: Assessing Value, Action Steps\n00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space\n00:35:39 Visually Focusing on a Goal Line Improves Performance\n00:43:50 How Vision Improves Performance: Blood Pressure\n00:51:55 Tool 2: Use Focal Vision to Initiate Goal Pursuit\n00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self-Images to Self-Motivate \n00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization of Goals is Only Helpful at the Start \n01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure is the Best Ongoing Motivator\n01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty \n01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus on 1-2 Major Goals Per Year\n01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity of Goals, Weekly Assessment\n01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure in Seeking Goals\n01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine\n01:34:26 How Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa\n01:38:10 Interim Summary of Goal-Pursuit Steps\n01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging \n01:49:59 Summary\n01:51:50 Subscribe, Sponsors, Patreon, Supplements: Thorne, Instagram, Twitter, Newsletter\n\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss the psychology and biology of desire, love and attachment. I explain how childhood attachment types are thought to inform adult attachment styles to romantic partners, and I describe some of the major theories of human mate selection, relationships and infidelity. Additionally, I explore the neurobiology and proposed subconscious processing underlying desire, love and attachment, including the roles of empathy and \u201cpositive delusion.\u201d I outline how self-awareness can shift one\u2019s relationship attachment style towards securely bonded partnerships.  Finally, I describe specific tools and supplements that have been researched to increase libido and sex drive. Throughout the episode, I explain the science and key mechanisms underlying romantic love and outline tools for those seeking to find a strong, healthy relationship, or for those wanting to strengthen an existing relationship. \n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Love\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticle Links\nRomantic love: an fMRI study of a neural mechanism for mate choice: https://bit.ly/34EuPWq\nRelationship-specific Encoding of Social Touch in Somatosensory and Insular Cortice: https://bit.ly/3rIambT\nInvestigating real-life emotions in romantic couples: a mobile EEG study: https://go.nature.com/3sG4ZJs\nBrain Knows Who Is on the Same Wavelength: Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility of a Female\u2013Male Relationship: https://bit.ly/3rMP3pO\nManipulation of Self-Expansion Alters Responses to Attractive Alternative Partners: https://bit.ly/3LuTYDA\nRandomized Clinical Trial on the Use of PHYSTA Freeze-Dried Water Extract of Eurycoma longifolia for the Improvement of Quality of Life and Sexual Well-Being in Men: https://bit.ly/3gKEtJy\n\nFor additional links and resources on Maca, Tongkat Ali and Tribulus, also see links in \u201cHuman Effect Matrix\u201d at examine.com. \n\nBook Links\nAttached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love: https://amzn.to/3HMLLZ2\nRight Brain Psychotherapy: https://amzn.to/3HJjXVs\nThe Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country\u2019s Foremost Relationship Expert: https://amzn.to/3LzS1FN\n\nOther Links\nThe Gottman Institute Love Lab: A Research-Based Approach to Relationships: https://bit.ly/3Bkrxn3\nNew York Times - The 36 Questions that Lead to Love (1/9/2015): https://nyti.ms/3HPAnvF\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Desire, Love & Attachment \n00:02:59 Odor, Perceived Attractiveness & Birth Control\n00:08:04 Thesis, AG1 (Athletic Greens), InsideTracker \n00:14:13 Romance: Balancing Love & Desire\n00:19:00 Animal Studies, Vasopressin & Monogamy \n00:22:06 Strange Situation Task, Childhood Attachment Styles\n00:32:52 Adult Attachment Styles\n00:38:50 Secure Attachment \n00:41:23 Autonomic Arousal: The \u201cSee-Saw\u201d\n00:50:39 Tool: Self-Awareness, Healthy Interdependence\n00:53:11 Neurobiology of Desire, Love & Attachment   \n00:58:02 Empathy & Mating & the Autonomic Nervous System\n01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch\n01:15:20 Relationship Stability \n01:21:22 Selecting Mates, Recognition of Autonomic Tone\n01:38:28  Neural Mechanisms of Romantic Attachment \n01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination in Relationships \n01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating\n02:08:56 \u201cChemistry\u201d, Subconscious Processes\n02:12:44 Tools: Libido & Sex Drive \n02:20:20 Maca (Maca root)   \n02:25:58 Tongkat Ali (Longjack) \n02:28:56 Tribulus terrestris \n02:33:14 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify/Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "My guest is Dr. Alia Crum, Associate (tenured) Professor of Psychology at Stanford University and Director of the Stanford Mind & Body Lab. Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise, and even to the foods we eat. We discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes whether it is satisfying to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also tells how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure, and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance. Throughout the episode, Dr. Crum provides descriptions of high-quality peer-reviewed scientific findings that we can all leverage toward better health and performance in our lives.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Mindset\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nThesis - https://takethesis.com/huberman\nROKA -  https://roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nDr. Alia Crum Links:\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/AliaCrum \nStanford Mind & Body Lab - https://mbl.stanford.edu \nSupport Dr. Crum\u2019s research at Stanford (tax-deductible) - https://mbl.stanford.edu/support \nDr. Crum\u2019s published work - https://mbl.stanford.edu/publications \n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nToolkit for changing stress mindsets - http://sparqtools.org/rethinkingstress/ \nPublication on mindsets & side effects - https://bit.ly/3AnUkGY\nChanging patient mindsets about non-life-threatening symptoms during oral immunotherapy - https://bit.ly/3FT4Irh\nStress, mindsets, and success in Navy SEALs special warfare training - https://bit.ly/3IAnS7d\nNutritional analysis of foods and beverages depicted in top-grossing US movies, 1994-2018 - https://bit.ly/3ItrrMn\nNutritional Analysis of Foods and Beverages Posted in Instagram Accounts of Highly Followed Celebrities - https://bit.ly/3nU42f0\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Alia Crum from Stanford University\n00:03:15 Thesis, ROKA, InsideTracker\n00:08:26 What Is a Mindset & What Does It Do? \n00:14:45 Mindsets Change Our Biological Responses to Food\n00:22:28 Beliefs About Our Food Matter\n00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects\n00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts the Effects of Exercise\n00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset About Fitness\n00:39:30 The Power of a \u2018Potency & Indulgence\u2019 Mindset\n00:42:03 Mindsets About Sleep, Tracking Sleep \n00:45:00 Making Stress Work For (or Against) You\n01:01:50 Mindsets Link Our Conscious & Subconscious\n01:04:50 3 Best Ways to Leverage Stress\n01:10:40 4 Things That Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets\n01:19:40 Mindsets About Medicines & Side Effects\n01:26:25 How to Teach Mindsets\n01:31:47 Dr. Crum\u2019s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds\n01:36:20 The Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources for Stress\n01:38:30 Synthesis, Participating in Research\n01:39:04 Subscribe, Sponsors, Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "This episode my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman, Distinguished Professor of Neurobiology at University of California, Los Angeles and a pioneering world expert in the science of respiration (breathing). We discuss how and why humans breathe the way we do, the function of the diaphragm and how it serves to increase oxygenation of the brain and body. We discuss how breathing influences mental state, fear, memory, reaction time, and more. And we discuss specific breathing protocols such as box-breathing, cyclic hyperventilation (similar to Wim Hof breathing), nasal versus mouth breathing, unilateral breathing, and how these each effect the brain and body. We discuss physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing, and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work. This conversation serves as a sort of \"Master Class\" on the science of breathing and breathing related tools for health and performance.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Breathing\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nThesis - https://takethesis.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nOur Breath Collective:\nhttps://www.ourbreathcollective.com/huberman\n\nDr. Jack Feldman Links:\nUCLA website - https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/jack-feldman\nWikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_L._Feldman\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/prebotzinger\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/jacklfeldman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Jack Feldman\n00:03:05 Sponsors: Thesis, Athletic Greens, Headspace, Our Breath Collective\n00:10:35 Why We Breathe \n00:14:35 Neural Control of Breathing: \u201cPre-Botzinger Complex\u201d\n00:16:20 Nose vs Mouth Breathing\n00:18:18 Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles\n00:20:11 Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus\n00:26:20 How We Breathe Is Special (Compared to Non-Mammals)\n00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements During Breathing\n00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin\n00:49:39 If We Don\u2019t Sigh, Our Lung (& General) Health Suffers\n01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions \n01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear \n01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing\n01:16:25 Facial Expressions\n01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness\n01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia\n01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI\n01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation\n01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers\n01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril\n01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.\n01:57:13 Dr. Feldman\u2019s Breathwork Protocols, Post-Lunch \n02:02:05 Deliberately Variable Breathwork: The Feldman Protocol\n02:06:29 Magnesium Threonate & Cognition & Memory \n02:18:27 Gratitude for Dr. Feldman\u2019s Highly Impactful Work\n02:20:53 Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, Thorne\n\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I review the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes. \n\nI describe two new systems for habit formation. The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation.\n\nI also discuss \"task bracketing\" as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). I also review the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits. \n\nThe science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more\u2014indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.\n\n#HubermanLab #Habits #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - http://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - http://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - http://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nExcellent review on science of habits - https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033417\nMeta-analysis on habits - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1539449219876877\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Habits; New Programs\n00:02:30 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep\n00:06:52 Habits versus Reflexes, Learning, Neuroplasticity\n00:08:51 Goal-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits\n00:11:40 How Long It (Really) Takes to Form a Habit; Limbic-Friction\n00:16:07 Linchpin Habits \n00:18:55 Mapping Your Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence\n00:22:55 Automaticity\n00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations\n00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors\n00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum\n00:37:08 States of Mind, Not Scheduling Time Predicts Habit Strength\n00:38:16 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 1\n00:46:29 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 2\n00:55:24 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 3\n01:01:34 Habit Flexibility\n01:04:57 Should We Reward Ourselves?

Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022. \n\nIn this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology. This episode includes lots of basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.\n\n#HubermanLab #DavidSinclair #Longevity\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://www.magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nDr. David Sinclair Links:\nLifespan Podcast: https://lifespanpodcast.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/davidasinclair \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/davidsinclairphd/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/davidsinclairpodcast \nLifespan (book): https://amzn.to/47MLimC\nAging Test Waitlist: https://www.tallyhealth.com\nHarvard Lab Website: https://sinclair.hms.harvard.edu\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School\n00:03:30 ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon\n00:07:45 \u201cAging as a Disease\u201d vs. Longevity & Anti-Aging\n00:10:23 What Causes Aging?

I explain the neural and hormonal basis for \"social homeostasis\" (our drive for a given amount of socializing) which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. I also discuss the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals, leads to more rapid bonding. I also discuss how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed science and practical tools for anyone seeking to find, build or end relationships.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Relationships\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Social Bonding: Child-Parent, Romantic, Friendship, Breakups\n00:02:55 ROKA, Athletic Greens, Headspace\n00:07:08 Social Bonding as a Biological Process\n00:10:03 Social Isolation\n00:13:32 Social Homeostasis & Neural Circuits for Social Drive \n00:18:55 Brain Areas & (Neuro)Chemistry of Social Drive \n00:22:48 What is Social Homeostasis & Dopamine\n00:27:00 When We Lack Social Interactions: Short- Versus Long-Term\n00:28:10 Introverts & Extroverts\n00:31:00 \u201cGood\u201d Versus \u201cBad\u201d Social Interactions & Hierarchies\n00:33:54 Loneliness & Dorsal Raphe Nucleus & Social Hunger \n00:37:33 Tools\n00:38:05 Socializing & Food Appetite: Crossover Craving\n00:42:45 Falling in Love\n00:45:05 Tools for Social Bonds: Merging Physiologies; Story\n00:53:54 Childhood Attachment Patterns in Adulthood\n01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment\n01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing\n01:09:45 Allan N.

Dr. Berson discovered the neurons in your eye that set your biological rhythms for sleep, wakefulness, mood and appetite. He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves. \n\nHere Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining: how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see, and remember. Also, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind, and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats. \n\nWe discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system\u2014one that, in just less than two hours, will teach you an entire course's worth about the brain and how yours works.\n\n#HubermanLab #Brain #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nInsideTracker Interview - https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-andrew-huberman\nDr. Berson's Webpage - \nhttps://vivo.brown.edu/display/dberson\nEyewire - (Contribute to Neuroscience Research from Home/Computer -\nhttps://eyewire.org/explore \nBest Neuroscience Textbook (NOTE this is a TEXTBOOK) - https://amzn.to/3lZWrL4\nBook - We Know It When We See It by Richard Masland - https://amzn.to/31S60Vp\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. David Berson \n00:02:55 Sponsors: Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon \n00:08:02 How We See \n00:10:02 Color Vision \n00:13:47 \u201cStrange\u201d Vision\n00:16:56 How You Orient In Time\n00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers\n00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight \n00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image\n00:41:03 Sense of Balance\n00:50:43 Why Pigeons Bob Their Heads, Motion Sickness \n01:00:03 Popping Ears\n01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight \n01:10:44 Why Tilted Motion Feels Good \n01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions\n01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & the \u201c2 Marshmallow Test\u201d\n01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex \n01:33:33 Neuroplasticity \n01:36:27 What is a Connectome?\n01:45:20 How to Learn (More About the Brain)\n01:49:04 Book Suggestion, my Berson Appreciation\n01:50:20 Zero-Cost ways to Support the HLP, Guest Suggestions, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how \"top-down\" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine and other drug-assisted therapies and more. I also review new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And I review the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, I review supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all.\n\n#fear #trauma #stress\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Fear, Trauma & Trauma \n00:02:15 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep\n00:06:49 What is Fear? \n00:11:45 Autonomic Arousal: \u201cAlertness\u201d vs. \u201cCalmness\u201d\n00:13:44 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA axis)\n00:17:36 \u201cThe Threat Reflex\u201d: Neural Circuits for Fear\n00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing\n00:32:27 Narratives: \u201cProtective or Dangerous\u201d\n00:35:58 Attaching Fear to Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory\n00:41:45 How Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA\n00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears\n00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies for Fear\n00:57:56 Repetition of Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences with Good\n01:05:28 EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing\n01:14:00 Social Connection & Isolation Are Chemically Powerful\n01:18:23 Trans-Generational Trauma\n01:25:00 PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin\n01:39:25 How Do You Know If You Are Traumatized? \n01:46:16 Deliberate Brief Stress Can Erase Fears & Trauma\n01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas In 5 Minutes Per Day\n01:59:42 Nutrition, Sleep, & Other General Support Erasing Fear & Trauma\n02:02:30 Supplements for Anxiety, Fear: Saffron, Inositol, Kava\n02:10:00 Synthesis \n02:11:46 Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Patreon, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss the science of gratitude, which has been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://www.magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nNeural Correlates of Gratitude (Damasio) - https://bit.ly/3oS8TNr\nReducing Inflammatory Cytokines & Fear With Gratitude - https://bit.ly/3oPsSwv\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction: Gratitude Science & Surprises\n00:01:50 Controlling Heart Rate with Story\n00:04:33 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon\n00:09:11 Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice\n00:12:20 Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, & Neural Circuits \n00:17:50 Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice\n00:21:22 Neurochemistry & Neural Circuits of Gratitude\n00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context\n00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables\n00:34:55 Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks & Story\n00:42:30 Theory of Mind Is Key\n00:45:50 Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration\n00:52:28 Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits \n00:56:15 You Can\u2019t Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance In Giving\n00:59:55 How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation\n01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day \n01:05:44 Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation & Fear with Gratitude\n01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin \n01:16:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces\n01:18:50 The Best Gratitude Practices: & How To, My Protocol\n01:24:25 Subscribe & Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements (Thorne)\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

We also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people\u2019s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And we discuss what Dr. Buss calls \u201cthe dark triad\u201d\u2014 features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.\n\nThis episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Buss' New Book \"When Men Behave Badly\" - https://amzn.to/3FThTsG\nDr. Buss' Website at University of Texas, Austin - https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/david-buss/\nDr. Buss' Twitter - https://twitter.com/ProfDavidBuss\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. David Buss\n00:04:10 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Headspace\n00:08:33 Choosing a Mate\n00:13:40 Long Term Mates: Universal Desires\n00:18:31 What Women & Men Seek in Long-Term Mates\n00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History \n00:32:20 Deception in Courtship\n00:37:30 Emotional Stability\n00:38:40 Lying About Long-Term Interest\n00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects\n00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching\n00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, How Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference\n00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment\n00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity\n01:04:35 Contraception \n01:06:22 Status & Mating Success\n01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence\n01:24:13 Specificity of Intimate Partner Violence  \n01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.\n01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy\n01:33:25 Stalking\n01:39:15 Influence of Children on Mate Value Assessments \n01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity\n01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships  \n01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety About the Truth\n02:02:12 Self Deception\n02:05:35 The Future of Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience  \n02:06:56 Books: When Men Behave Badly; The Evolution of Desire, Textbooks\n02:10:42 Concluding Statements, Zero-Cost Support: Subscribe, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. I include ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Time Perception, Note on Fasting & Supplements\n00:05:12 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker\n00:09:25 Entrainment, Circannual Entrainment, Melatonin\n00:13:20 Seasonal Oscillations in Testosterone & Estrogen, Tool 1\n00:16:06 Circadian Timing, Tools 1, 2, 3 (for Circadian Entrainment)\n00:21:13 Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window\n00:23:00 When Circadian Entrainment is Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers\n00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus\n00:31:42 Our Sense of the Passage of Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective\n00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead to Time Overestimation; Frame Rate \n00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate\n00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across the Day; Tool 7: When to Do Rigid vs. Creative Work\n00:42:38 Example of Tool 7\n00:43:38 How Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance\n00:44:38 Trauma, \u201cOver-clocking\u201d & Memories; Adjusting Rates of Experience\n00:50:04 Why Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal\n00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8\n00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate in Discomfort\n00:56:30 Fun \u201cFeels Fast\u201d BUT Is Remembered as Slow; Boring Stuff \u201cFeels Slow,\u201d Recall As Fast\n01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding with Places & People\n01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets the Start of Each Time Bin on Our Experience\n01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units of Each Day)\n01:11:58 Synthesis & Book Suggestion (Your Brain Is a Time Machine by D.

We discuss specific resistance (weight) training regimens for increasing testosterone in men and women and how to vary mechanical loads and rest between sets and workouts to optimize hormone output and training results. We also discuss how stress-induced \"catecholamines\" can increase testosterone or decrease it, depending on duration and mindset. And we discuss specific cold- and heat- therapies for increasing resilience, reducing inflammation, heat shock proteins and more. We discuss nutrition for training and how to match nutrition to training goals and metabolic flexibility. We discuss mental focus and how long to train for skill development. Finally, we discuss how mixed martial arts and the UFC Performance Institute are a template for exploring human performance more generally. This episode is intended for anyone interested in athletic and mental performance: athletes, students, and recreational exercisers and includes both science and many practical tools people can apply in their own training. \n\n#UFC #UFC268 #HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://roka.com -- code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep - https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://headspace.com/specialoffer \n\nDr. Duncan French:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/dr_duncan_french\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-french-phd-a41bb9122\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. Duncan French \n00:02:27 Roka, Helix Sleep, Headspace\n00:05:44 Duncan\u2019s Background in Exercise Science\n00:11:45 How Certain Exercises Increase Testosterone\n00:16:22 What Kind of Training Increases Testosterone & Growth Hormone?\n00:20:19 Intensity: Mechanical Load; Volume: Metabolic Load; Inter-set Rest Periods\n00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals  \n00:29:35 How Stress Can Increase or Decrease Testosterone \n00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure for Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth\n00:46:55 Skill Development\n00:50:05 Why Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role of Nutrition \n00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets on Performance\n00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose During Ketosis\n00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition to Training, \u201cNeeds Based Eating\u201d\n01:05:00 Duncan\u2019s Work with Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)\n01:08:00 Why UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Are So Valuable for Advancing Performance\n01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Between Different States of Arousal\n01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better at Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna\n01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective Data\n01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects of The UFC and UFC Performance Institute\n01:27:45 Conclusions, Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "This episode I describe science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and for nervous system health generally.\n\nI describe 10 tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids which make up the \"structural fat\" of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.\n\nThen I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental,  in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than 10 actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function, and it explains modern neuroscience underlying of our sense of taste, our food seeking preferences and brain metabolism.\n\n#HubermanLab #Diet #Brain\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code: \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nRETHINK EDUCATION: The Biology of Learning Featuring Dr. Andrew Huberman:\nhttps://youtu.be/Oo7hQapFe3M\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nReview on Anthocyanins & Cognition - https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/23/4255\nReview on Creatine & Brain Health Studies - https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/586\nReview on \"Rethinking Food Reward\" - www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011643\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Food & Brain Function Introduction\n00:02:08 Summary: Critical Aspects of Time Restricted Feeding/Fasting\n00:04:19 Sponsors: Roka, Athletic Greens, Headspace\n00:08:24 Neuroplasticity Super Protocol (Zero-Cost Tools) Online\n00:09:22 Eating to Enhance Brain Function & Foundational Aspects of Brain Health \n00:13:00 Eating Fats for Brain Health, EFAs Phospholipids (Tool 1: 1-3g EPA Omega-3/day) \n00:20:35 Phosphatidylserine (Tool 2: 300mg/day)\n00:22:15 Choline, Egg Yolks (Tool 3: 1-2g/day Threshold)\n00:28:26 Hydration & Electrolytes (Tool 4)\n00:29:50 Liquid Fish Oil/Capsules (2-3g EPA per day; 300mg Alpha GPC 2-4X/week)\n00:32:22 Creatine for Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day) \n00:36:28 Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries) \n00:41:19 L-Glutamine (Tool: 1-10g/day) & Offsetting Apnea & Inflammation\n00:49:23 Neural Basis of Food Preference, Yum, Yuck, Meh; Taste, Guts, & Beliefs\n00:55:25 Taste is 100% In your Head\n00:59:50 Gut Neurons Controlling Food Preference: Neuropod Cells; (Tool 7: Fermented Foods) \n01:06:14 Capsule Probiotics, Brain Fog \n01:07:16 Learning to Like Specific Tastes: Sweetness & Brain Metabolism\n01:12:11 Hard-Wiring & Soft-Wiring\n01:13:25 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners: Safe or Harmful Depends on (Glucose) Context\n01:18:15 Non-Caloric Sweetener & Insulin; (Tool 8: Don\u2019t Have w/Glucose Elevating Foods)\n01:22:17 Beliefs & Thoughts; The Insula; (Tool 9: Pairing-Based Reshaping Food Preferences) \n01:30:42 Liking Neuro-Healthy Foods & Bettering Brain Metabolism (Tool 10); Food Wars\n01:36:05 Food Reward & Diabetes, Obesity; Important Review Article (See Caption)\n01:38:28 Synthesis, Zero-Cost Support, Future Topic Suggestions, Sponsors, Supplements\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.\n\nI discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic \"washout\" of brain debris during sleep. I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation). \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code: \"huberman\"\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nHow and Why The Immune System Makes Us Sleep - https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2576\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 The Mind & Immune System, New Findings: Acupuncture & Fascia\n00:03:00 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker\n00:07:41 Foundational Tools & Practices for a Healthy Immune System\n00:11:20 Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System\n00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (\u201cEat Me!\u201d Signals), Cytokines (\u201cHelp Me!\u201d Signals)\n00:21:06 The Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies\n00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome and \u201cScrubbing\u201d Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing\n00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Your Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods\n00:34:20 Some Interleukins Are Anti-Inflammatory\n00:34:56 Sickness Behavior\n00:39:08 Some People Seek Care When Sick, Others Want to be Alone\n00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines\n00:43:40 Reduced Appetites When Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido\n00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness\n00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Your Brain State\n00:55:04 Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin, 5HTP\n01:07:03 Tool 6: Hot Showers, Saunas, Baths & Cortisol, Heath-Cold Contrast\n01:10:53 Feed a Fever & Starve a Cold (?), Adrenaline\n01:12:36 Tool 7: Activating Your Immune System w/Cyclic-Hyperventilation, Alkalinity\n01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine\n01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, You Can Worry Yourself Sick\n01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold Exposure\n01:42:05 Once You\u2019re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis\n01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells\n01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism for How It Reduces Inflammation; Fascia, Rolfing \n01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices\n01:58:00 Synthesis, Ways to Support Us (Zero-Cost), Sponsors, Supplements, Social Media\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I host Dr. Samer Hattar, Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. And he offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jetlag, shift work, and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing. This episode is filled with cutting-edge data on the biological mechanisms of human physiology and practical tools for people of all ages. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #CircadianRhythm\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code: \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://www.magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nSupport Research in Huberman Lab at Stanford:\nhttps://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSamer Hattar:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/samerhattar\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/samerhattar\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samer_Hattar\n\nLinks:\nGraphical Explanation of Temperature Minimum for Overcoming Jetlag: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKWiRVJHVwC/\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Samer Hattar, Ph.D.\n00:02:17 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon\n00:06:15 Light, Circadian (24 hour) & Circannual (365 day) \u201cPhotoentrainment\u201d \n00:14:30 Neurons in Our Eyes That Set Our Body Clocks: Similar to Frog Skin\n00:18:55 What Blind People See \n00:20:15 When, How & How Long to View Light for Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness\n00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps\n00:33:48 Are You Jetlagged at Home?

    "short_description": "This episode I discuss the science and practice of fasting also called time-restricted feeding. I review the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. I explain how \"fasted\" is contextual, and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise, or with glucose disposal agents. I also discuss the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. I also discuss what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol and on fertility. I also review how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting, and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. I discuss mechanisms and offer tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.\n\n#HubermanLab #Fasting #FatLoss\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nRETHINK EDUCATION: The Biology of Learning Featuring Dr. Andrew Huberman\nhttps://youtu.be/Oo7hQapFe3M\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nComprehensive Review On Fasting In Humans: https://bit.ly/3BwIyd7\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction, Blood Glucose & Mortality, Mice Vs.

    "short_description": "This episode I am joined by Dr. Craig Heller, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and world expert on the science of temperature regulation. We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how most everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster, as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs! Our conversation includes both many practical tools and mechanistic science.\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nSupport Research in Huberman Lab at Stanford:\nhttps://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Heller's Website - https://profiles.stanford.edu/h-craig-heller\nCoolMitt Technology - https://www.coolmitt.com\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Craig Heller, Physiology & Performance\n00:02:00 Sponsors: Roka, Inside Tracker, Athletic Greens\n00:06:45 Cold Showers, Ice Baths, Cryotherapy\n00:10:45 Boundary Layers \n00:11:55 Cooling Before Aerobic Activity to Enhance Performance\n00:14:45 Anaerobic Activity Locally Increases Muscle Heat\n00:16:45 Temperature Gates Our Energy Use \n00:19:00 Local Versus Systemic Fatigue: Heat Is Why We Fail\n00:22:10 Cooling Off: Most Methods are Counterproductive\n00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog\n00:27:45 Hyperthermia\n00:31:50 Best Body Sites for Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face \n00:38:00 Cooling Your Brain via The Upper Face; Concussion\n00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!)

We discuss the biology and medical clinical-trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD.\u00a0Dr. Johnson teaches us what the clinical trials in his lab are revealing about the potential these compounds hold for the treatment of depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD, and other disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory, start to finish, including the conditions for optimal clinical outcomes. And he explains some of the potential hazards and common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine. Dr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks of certain people and age groups using psychedelics and the ever evolving legal and pharmaceutical industry landscape surrounding psychedelics. Dr. Johnson also explains how the scientific study of psychedelics is likely to set the trajectory of psychiatric medicine in the years to come. Dr. Johnson is among a small handful of researchers who have pioneered the clinical study of these powerful compounds. He has unprecedented insight into how they can be woven into other psychiatric treatments, changing ones sense of self and of reality. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - http://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - http://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nDr. Matthew Johnson Social Media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Drug_Researcher\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drug_researcher\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Johnson\u2019s Website at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine - https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/johnson\nChris Letheby\u2019s forthcoming book - https://amzn.to/3nMTaAs \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Matthew Johnson\n00:02:10 Supporting Sponsors\n00:06:40 \u2018Psychedelics\u2019 Defined\n00:14:09 Hallucinations, Synesthesia, Altered Space-Time Perception\n00:19:56 Serotonin & Dopamine \n00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate \n00:28:00 An Example Psychedelic Experiment\n00:37:30 \u2018Letting Go\u2019 with Psychedelics\n00:44:10 Our Mind\u2019s Eye\n00:48:00 Redefining Your Sense of Self \n00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings to Daily Life\n01:04:36 Flashbacks\n01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing\n01:15:54 MDMA, DMT\n01:26:00 Dangers of Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis\n01:38:15 Micro-Dosing\n01:56:45 Risks for Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials\n02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation\n02:18:35 Psychedelics for Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury \n02:27:45 Shifting Trends in Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture\n02:44:23 Participating in a Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork \n02:50:38 Conclusions, Subscribing & Supporting the HLP, Supplements\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): what it is, the common myths, and the biology and psychology of ADHD.\n\nI discuss both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD, and brain-machine interface tools. I also discuss behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD, and for people of different ages. I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional \"blinks\" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD). \n\nThe role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed. Throughout, both basic science and clinical scenarios, as well as applicable tools and resources are covered.\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSupport Research in the Huberman Lab at Stanford:\nhttps://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nReview of Compounds for ADHD, Smart Drugs & Focus - https://www.fbscience.com/Landmark/articles/10.52586/4948\nReview of Atypical Compounds for ADHD - https://www.hindawi.com/journals/np/2016/1320423/\nStudy of Focus Protocol In ADHD & Non-ADHD Children - https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4780\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction & Note About Diagnosis\n00:03:27 Sponsors \n00:07:56 ADHD vs. ADD: Genetics, IQ, Rates in Kids & Adults\n00:13:00 Attention & Focus, Impulse Control\n00:14:57 Hyper-focus \n00:16:45 Time Perception\n00:18:25 The Pile System\n00:20:00 Working Memory\n00:24:10 Hyper-Focus & Dopamine \n00:26:40 Neural Circuits In ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks \n00:32:57 Low Dopamine in ADHD & Stimulant Use & Abuse\n00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil \n00:47:00 Non-Prescribed Adderall, Caffeine, Nicotine\n00:49:18 How Stimulants \u201cTeach\u201d the Brains of ADHD Children to Focus\n00:52:00 When To Medicate: A Highly Informed (Anecdotal) Case Study\n00:56:35 Elimination Diets & Allergies In ADHD\n01:04:46 Omega-3 Fatty Acids: EPAs & DHAs \n01:07:00 Modulation vs Mediation of Biological Processes\n01:10:50 Attentional Blinks \n01:16:56 Open Monitoring & 17 minute Focus Enhancement \n01:22:50 Blinking, Dopamine & Time Perception; & Focus Training \n01:30:10 Reverberatory Neural & Physical Activity\n01:33:40 Adderall, Ritalin & Blink Frequency\n01:35:00 Cannabis \n01:37:30 Interoceptive Awareness \n01:41:15 Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil; Smart Drugs & Caffeine: Dangers\n01:48:05 DHA Fatty Acids, Phosphatidylserine\n01:50:54 Ginko Biloba \n01:51:45 Modafinil & Armodafanil: Dopamine Action & Orexin\n01:56:19 Acetylcholine: Circuits Underlying Focus; Alpha-GPC\n01:59:04 L-Tyrosine, (PEA) Phenylethylamine \n02:01:23 Racetams, Noopept \n02:05:15 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Combining Technology & Pharmacology \n02:09:14 Smart Phones & ADHD & Sub-Clinical Focus Issues In Adults & Kids\n02:14:30 Synthesis/Summary\n02:16:10 Support for Podcast & Research, Supplement Resources\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss what drives hunger and satiety, and the role our brain, stomach,  fat and hormones play in regulating hunger and turning off the desire to eat more. I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.\n\nThen I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the \"perfectionist\" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. I also discuss new more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia, and both their promise and risks.\n\nI review the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD. Finally, I discuss \"cheat days,\" body dysmorphia and the growing list of novel forms of eating disorders start to finish. As always, science and science-based tools are discussed.\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nSupport Research in Huberman Lab at Stanford:\nhttps://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin Newsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nIngesting Protein in the Morning Supports Muscle Maintenance & Growth: https://bit.ly/3DPlms7\n\nStudies Using Virtual Reality to Explore Eating & Hunger & Body Image: \nhttps://bit.ly/3BGaDya\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2WWGRq8\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction: Fasting, & Defining Healthy Eating\n00:08:55 Morning Protein Is Important \n00:22:04 Sponsors\n00:26:29 Defining & Diagnosing Eating Disorders\n00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)\n00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)\n00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica\n00:39:44 What is Hunger?

We discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress, and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context. We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone \u2014 how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And we discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society. \n\n#HubermanLab #Testosterone #Stress\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://roka.com - use code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin Newsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Sapolsky's most recent book, \"Behave: The Biology of Humans At Our Best & Worst\": https://amzn.to/3yrZ6k7\nSupport Research in the Huberman Lab at Stanford on Stress, Sleep & Human Performance: https://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction: Dr. Robert Sapolsky \n00:02:26 Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker \n00:06:30 Stress: Short & Long-Term, Good & Bad \n00:09:11 Valence & Amygdala \n00:11:00 Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths \n00:15:15 Behaviors that Affect Testosterone  \n00:17:20 Mindsets & Contexts that Affect Testosterone\n00:20:28 How Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels  \n00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female \n00:24:05 Testosterone: The Challenge Hypothesis \n00:29:20 How Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation \n00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity BUT TIMING IS KEY \n00:39:40 Are Testosterone & Sperm Counts in Males Really Dropping? \n00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Our Sense of Control \n00:51:35 How Best to Buffer Stress \n00:57:04 Power of Perception, Choice & Individual Differences \n01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy \n01:11:20 How Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking  \n01:13:17 Do We Have Free Will? \n01:20:50 How to Apply Knowledge & Learning  \n01:23:44 Robert\u2019s New Book: \u201cDetermined: The Science of Life Without Free Will\u201d \n01:28:27 Reflections, Support of Podcast, & Supporting Stress Research \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.\n\n#Depression #HubermanLab #Dopamine\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin Newsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nReview of EPAs for the Treatment of Depression - https://bit.ly/2Wl15ti\nReview of Creatine for the Treatment of Depression - https://www.mdpi.com/520864\nRecent Study on the Clinical Use of Psilocybin for Treatment of Depression - https://bit.ly/3sFSGMM\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Mood Disorders & Maintaining Mental Health (Protocol 1)\n00:07:10 Sponsors\n00:11:15 Major Depression\n00:18:40 \u201cAnti-Self\u201d Confabulation\n00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms of Depression\n00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin\n00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\n00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving, Serotonin/Emotions\n00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain are Linked: Substance P\n00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol \n00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility to Depression: Impact of Stress \n00:50:50 Understanding Biological Mechanism Is Key: Recipes versus Skills\n00:52:50 Tools for Dealing with Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)\n00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.\n00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*\n01:02:50 How EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine, Quinolinic Acid\n01:05:25 Protocol 4: How Exercise Offsets Depression \n01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*\n01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function\n01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) for Major Depression: Psilocybin*\n01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)\n01:54:50 Summary of Protocols Covered\n02:00:10 Support & Additional Resources\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "This episode I discuss our sense of pain and pleasure: where and how they each arise in our mind and body and various ways to control their intensity. I discuss the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. I also discuss whole body pain, pain \"syndromes\" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. I discuss neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described.\n\nNote: The description of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was intentionally simplified and does not include mention of dorsal horn spinal relay neurons, etc..

    "short_description": "This episode I interview Dr. Anna Lembke, MD, Chief of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist expert in treating addictions of all kinds: drugs, alcohol, food, sex, video games, gambling, food, medication, etc. Dr. Lembke is also an expert in the opioid crisis, and the author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence (https://amzn.to/3AHHGBp).\n\nWe discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our \"dopamine balance\" plays in creating addiction. We also discuss the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying and she explains why telling the truth\u2014even about the most basic things in daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain.\n\nThis episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean. Last but not least, it helps explain why all humans do what we do, and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of pleasure seeking in life.\n\n#HubermanLab #Addiction #Dopamine\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Anna Lembke Links:\nWebsite: https://www.annalembke.com\nStanford Profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/anna-lembke\nDopamine Nation (new book): https://amzn.to/3Ra4qEa\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. Anna Lembke, Addiction Expert\n00:02:25 Disclaimer & Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Headspace\n00:07:00 Dopamine, Happiness & Impulsivity \n00:15:56 What Is Pleasure? \n00:18:20 Addiction, Boredom & Passion for Life\n00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction\n00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia\n00:30:47 Are All Addictions the Same?\n00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead to Creativity \n00:40:35 Finding Your Passion Starts with Boredom & Action Steps \n00:50:05 How to Break an Addiction\n00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers\n01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted To \u201cSobriety\u201d? \n01:11:45 Are We All Wired for Addiction? \n01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction\n01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Are Heroes\n01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame\n01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA \n01:40:20 Social Media Addiction \n01:51:25 Narcissism \n01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise\n01:58:10 Reciprocity\n02:01:15 Closing Comments, Resources\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "short_description": "This episode I describe how the organs of the body influence the function and health of our brain and how our brain controls our bodily organs. The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. I describe how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways. I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.\n\n#HubermanLab #Brain #Health\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code: huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nSonnenburg, Cell Press Study - https://bit.ly/SonnenburgCellPress\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Your Sense of Self: Interoception\n00:01:25 Protocol 1: Fermented Foods, Not Fiber, to Reduce Inflammation \n00:03:30 Attributions\n00:08:22 Main Drivers of Feelings & Performance\n00:11:45 Brain-Body: A Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue \n00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue  \n00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate With Breathing\n00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors\n00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, From Air to Blood\n00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert While Calm\n00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex\n00:42:47 Gut Volume & The Desire to Open Your Mouth \n00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting \n00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar\n00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings with Specific Amino Acid Nutrients \n00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)\n01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome \n01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented \n01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented Foods\n01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine\n01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin\n01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog\n01:21:45 Nausea: Happens in Your Brain; Area Postrema\n01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.\n01:30:40 Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT\n01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling the Blood Properly\n01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress\n01:41:50 Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions\n01:45:00 Sensing Other People\u2019s Emotions via the Body\n01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat \n01:50:40 Conclusions & Resources\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I explain how smell and taste reflect brain health and can be used to assess and even promote brain regeneration. Both basic science and protocols are described including how to make sour things taste sweet and how to develop a heightened sense of smell and taste.\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code: huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com\n\nLinks:\n1.

I also describe how we can train and support our visual system to improve at any age. I describe more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally). I also explain how to use eyesight to improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy eyes and colorblindness occur. I also describe various compounds that may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our vision. Many simple, zero-cost protocols and a lot of scientific mechanisms are covered in this episode in clear language anyone can understand-- it is for anyone that values their brain and their eyesight, whether young, adult-age or advanced age. \n\n#HubermanLab #EyeSight #Vision\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLink to eye exercise videos for smooth pursuit, amblyopia, etc. \n(Numbering of videos does correspond to numbers in episode caption.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/VisualExercises/videos\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:04:51 Protocol: Concurrent Training For Endurance, Strength, Hypertrophy \n00:07:24 The Senses, Vision, Seeing & What We Should All Do To See Better  \n00:10:35 Our Eyes: What They Really Do, & How They Work \n00:14:30 Converting Light Into Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion Cells   \n00:17:00 We Don\u2019t See Anything Directly: It Is All A Comparison Of Reflected Light \n00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View Of The World) \n00:24:05 Everything You See Is A Best Guess, Blind Spots \n00:25:50 Depth Perception \n00:28:00 Subconscious Vision: Light, Mood, Metabolism, Dopamine; Frog\u2019s Skin In Your Eyes \n00:32:00 Blue-Yellow Light, Sunlight; & Protocol 1 For Better Biology & Psychology;  \n00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours Per Day \n00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Your Pupils & Your Bendy Lens \n00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing For 20min For Every 90 Minutes of \u201cClose Viewing\u201d \n00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Yourself Through Space Daily \n00:54:26 Protocol 5: Be More Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Up Versus Down \n00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep In A Very Dark Room To Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness) \n01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,  \n01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Your Vision Sharp With Distance Viewing Every Day \n01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit \n01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times a Week \n01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol To Improve Photoreceptors & Vision \n01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11  \n01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity; Protocol 12 \n01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Your Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training  \n01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: The Consequence of An Under-Active Visual Brain\n01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: A Simple, Cost-Free Way To Test & Maintain Vision  \n01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow \n01:44:20 Summary of Protocols, Vital Point About Blood & Oxygen For Vision\n01:46:00 Episode Length, Captions, Zero-Cost Support, Instagram, Searching Topics\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I explain muscle metabolism and muscle fiber recruitment. I detail protocols for increasing muscular growth and for neuro-muscular recovery. I explain the effects of deliberate cold, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-histamines on training progress. I describe science-supported protocols using certain weight load ranges, total sets per week, training intensity, frequency, and in-between set activities if one's goal is to increase muscle growth, strength or endurance. I review three foundational compounds and nutrients and three optimization compounds and nutrients that have been shown to improve neuro-muscular performance. Finally, I explain how to leverage exercise and weight training to enhance cognitive function.\n\n#HubermanLab #MuscleGrowth #Exercise\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman   \nHeadspace - https://headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:10:58 Protocol For Fat Loss: (Zero-Cost) PDF Available At: thecoldplunge.com\n00:12:45 Muscle Is A Slave To the Nervous System\n00:16:22 Why We Have A Brain\n00:17:38 Flexors, Extensors, & Mutual Inhibition\n00:20:00 How Muscles Move, Making & Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP\n00:23:29 The \u201cBurn\u201d Is Not Lactic Acid.

I describe the four kinds of endurance: muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the visual physiological basis of the \"extra gear\" we all can leverage for effort.

I also describe what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. I also cover the science of skill-based visualization which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. I discuss auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training \u2018deliberately idle\u2019 sessions. I cover how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more.

    "short_description": "This episode I explain the science of heating and cooling the body, a process called thermoregulation-- and how to apply that knowledge to significantly improve physical performance. I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives. Finally, I discuss the temperature effects of caffeine, alcohol and anti-inflammatory compounds. The information in this episode is focused on mechanisms and tools for increasing athletic or exercise performance.\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix - https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nTheragun - https://theragun.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:05:08 Physical Performance & Skill Learning \n00:06:40 Optimal Learning Protocol (Recap): 4 Steps \n00:08:31 Variables Impacting Physical Performance \n00:10:00 Temperature Is the Dominant Variable \n00:12:08 Understanding Mechanism Is Key  \n00:13:42 Heat: The Enemy of All Performance (& Why) \n00:16:30 Blood Flow & Sweating & Piloerection \n00:22:35 Heat Is What Limits Effort: Even If You Feel Fine/Motivated \n00:25:29 Proper Cooling Can Double, Triple, Quadruple (Or More) Your Ability \n00:26:42 Heat Induced Confusion & Death \n00:30:02 The Three Body Parts Best For Heating & Cooling Your Whole Body \n00:31:38 Face, Palms, Bottoms of Feet; Glabrous Skin \n00:33:00 Arterio-Venous Anastamoses (AVAs) Are Super Cool(ing)! \n00:37:15 Palmar Cooling Can Supercharge Your Athletic Performance \n00:38:35 ATP, Pyruvate Kinase & Heat  \n00:40:55 Palmer Cooling Outperforms Anabolic Steroids Several-Fold \n00:43:45 Increasing Endurance, Willpower & Persistence \n00:46:33 Cardiac Drift, & Moving the \u201dI Quit\u201d Point \n00:50:44 Deliberate Heating: Myths and Better Protocols  \n00:53:20 Protocols For Self-Directed Cooling To Vastly Improve Performance \n00:59:23 How To Use Cold To Recover Faster & More Thoroughly \n01:02:05 Ice Baths & Cold Showers Can Prevent Training Progress: mTOR, etc. \n01:06:29 Alcohol, Caffeine, NSAIDs: Their Temperature Effects Matter \n01:09:44 Are Stimulants Counter Productive For Performance?

    "short_description": "This episode I describe the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don't realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. I explain how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day-- a practice is rarely discussed but very well supported by the science literature. I also discuss an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. I discuss if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation-- it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matters. And I discuss the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss. The episode includes a lot of tools, links to cost-free resources and explanation of the science underlying each tool for fat loss.\n\n#HubermanLab #FatLoss #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - http://insidetracker.com/huberman\nExpressVPN - http://expressvpn.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - http://athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nCold Protocols via The Cold Plunge:\nhttps://thecoldplunge.com/pages/protocols\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab/\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:06:00 Fat Loss: The Key Role of Neurons \n00:08:44 The First Law of Fat Loss \n00:11:00 Neurons Connect To Fat!

Cortisol and adrenaline powerfully regulate our levels of energy, focus and immune system function. I describe various science-supported tools and practices to increase or decrease cortisol and/or adrenaline, depending on one's specific needs and goals. I also describe the biology of nootropics, and how cortisol and adrenaline can improve or degrade learning. Finally, I review the scientific data and tools for timing the release of these hormones to improve memory, energy and immune system function. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #ImmuneSystem\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nIntermittent Fasting & Growth Hormone Mechanism: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2017.10.016\nHabitual Coffee Drinking & Changes In Brain Connectivity: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01075-4\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:05:41 Energy & Your Immune System, & Learning Faster \n00:08:34 Why & How Intermittent Fasting Increases Growth Hormone\n00:11:56 Why Your Stomach Growls  \n00:13:09 Hot Baths & Hormones \n00:14:35 Energy, Adrenaline (Epinephrine), & Cortisol\n00:15:48 Cortisol & Cholesterol, Competition With Testosterone & Estrogen\n00:17:54 Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Is Your (Immune Systems) Best Friend\n00:18:48 Cortisol Basics In Two (Actually 1) Minute/s\n00:19:48 Adrenaline Basics In Two Minutes\n00:21:32 Tool: Time Your Cortisol Peak To Waking Using Specific Light Intensities\n00:27:20 Brief Increases In Cortisol & Adrenaline Boost Energy, Focus & Immunity\n00:30:04 Ways To Increase Adrenaline, Epinephrine & Cortisol & Why That Is Good\n00:35:00 Does Mindset During Stress Matter?\n00:36:15 Protocols: Adrenaline Breathing Described\n00:39:00 Practices To Increase Energy Without Increasing Stress\n00:45:00 Using Stressors to ENHANCE Our Immune System: Science & Tools\n00:55:11 Timing Thyroid Release For Energy \n00:57:02 Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.

    "short_description": "This episode I discuss metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it\u2019s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks. Throughout the episode, mechanism and tools grounded in specific mechanisms are discussed.

    "short_description": "This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite-- and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering the release of the hormone CCK, and more. \n\nNote: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I misspoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said \u201cP-M-O-C\u201d but should have said \u201cPOMC\u201d. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: \"proopiomelanocortin\".\n\n#HubermanLab #Hunger #Hormones\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): httpS://athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Lustig\u2019s Lecture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxyxcTZccsE \nPaper In Cell Metabolism On Processed Food Effects - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008  \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:06:59 Hunger: Neural & Hormonal Control  \n00:08:32 Chewing & Hunger  \n00:11:05 Siamese Rats Reveal the Importance of Hormones In Hunger \n00:13:08 Neurons That Powerfully Control Hunger by Releasing Specific Hormones \n00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating\n00:16:57 Why Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -MSH) \n00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism \n00:22:30 Ghrelin: A Hormone That Determines When You Get Hungry, & That You Can Control \n00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not the Other Way Around \n00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting \n00:29:35 How To Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: The 45min Per Day Rule \n00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): A Hormone In Your Gut That Says \u201cNo Mas!\u201d \n00:34:55 Eating For Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar  \n00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates the Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings \n00:43:42 Things To Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing \n00:49:32 \u201cA Calorie Is NOT A Calorie\u201d After All \n00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia  \n00:56:12 The Order Your Eat Foods Matters: Managing Your Blood Glucose & Glucagon \n01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4 \n01:04:50 Why Sugar Stimulates Your Appetite  \n01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable With Specific Exercises, The Power Of Insulin Sensitivity \n01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism \n01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver, Adrenals \n01:15:00 Prescription Compounds That Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin  \n01:16:45 Berberine: A Potent Glucose Buffer That Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels, Canker Sores \n01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, & Zinc \n01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity  \n01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects On Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones \n01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine \n01:31:08 The Power of GLP-1 & Yerba Mate For Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes \n01:35:19 Summary & Notes About Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone \n01:37:20 Zero Cost & Sponsor-Based Ways To Support The Huberman Lab Podcast \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "This episode I discuss the hormones testosterone and estrogen and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior at ages after puberty. I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex, or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: \"what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?\"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause. As always a mix of basic science, biological mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed.\n\n**Note: Future episodes will focus on the science of prescription hormone replacement therapies, the science of hormone-based birth control and the role of testosterone, estrogen and other compounds in fertility, athletic performance and recovery.\n\n#HubermanLab #Testosterone #Estrogen \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nFour Sigmatic - https://foursigmatic.com/huberman \nBlinkist - https://blinkist.com/huberman \nTheragun - https://theragun.com/huberman \n\nBloodwork sponsor\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nReferences:\nExamine: https://examine.com\n\u201cBehavioral Endocrinology\u201d by Nelson and Kriegsfeld 5th Ed.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:05:50 Hormone Optimization  \n00:07:00 Salutogenesis: A Powerful Way to Conceptualize Health \n00:10:03 Estrogen and Testosterone: Sources, Levels & Ratios  \n00:15:46 The Power of Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine\n00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation \n00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido In Males \n00:23:10 How Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence \n00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding \n00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects on Levels/Ratios  \n00:28:45 Behaviors That Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin \n00:31:24 How Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6 \n00:33:20 How Exactly Do Behaviors Change Hormones?  \n00:34:18 Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, & Mate Recognition \n00:43:33 Apnea: A Powerful Bi-Directional Influence On Estrogen & Testosterone \n00:47:44 Mouth vs. Nose Breathing & Hormone Levels: Effects Via Sleep and Direct Effects \n00:51:11 How Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone and Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios \n00:53:49 02:CO2 Ratios, Nasal Breathing During Exercise \n00:56:30 Light Viewing Patterns & Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH \n00:57:44 Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency \n01:04:39 Specificity of Hormone Effects \n01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads \n01:14:10 How To Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing \n01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First or Last?)

I review published data on environmental factors shown to powerfully alter hormone pathways in animals and humans and the effects of cannabis, alcohol and cell phones on testes, sperm, ovaries and hormones. I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences. As always, basic information and tools are discussed.\n\n#HubermanLab #Testosterone #Estrogene\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nMood Meter: https://moodmeterapp.com/ \nNSDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo \nCell Phones & Hormones: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138021/ \nFinger Length Ratios & Hormones/Sexual Orientation: \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/35006555 \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2940503/ \nLeVay Study in Science Magazine on Sexual Orientation Brain Dimorphism: \nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/253/5023/1034\n\nTimestamps below.\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:06:47 Announcement: Mood Meter App Works Again\n00:08:00 Maximizing Learning from the Podcast\n00:10:00 New Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol, Spanish Subtitles \n00:11:35 Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons & Behavior \n00:14:15 Hormones Basics \n00:15:26 Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex,  \n00:17:50 Y Chromosome Inhibition of Feminization  \n00:19:00 Placenta Is An Endocrine (Hormone-Producing) Organ, Adrenal Testosterone \n00:19:45 Hormonal Sex, Morphological Sex \n00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn On Genes \n00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization \n00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development  \n00:27:03 Secondary Sexual Characteristics \n00:27:43 Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces  \n00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes The Brain  \n00:33:15 Breast Development In Males: Aromatase; Puberty, & Steroids in Athletes \n00:34:50 Estrogen Powerfully Controls Brain Development In All Individuals \n00:35:19 Avoiding Hormonal Disruption In Children & Adults: Specific Oils, Creams, Etc.  \n00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline \n00:44:20 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Hormones Need Receptors, SARMS\n00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes \u201cMasculine\u201d Brain Circuits, Testosterone \n00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: In Babies, Puberty & Adults \n00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects On Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles \n01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around the World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase  \n01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss  \n01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates By Pubertal Rates \n01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione \n01:14:26 Intersex Moles \n01:15:40 Marijuana Plants, Pollens: Plant-To-Animal \u201cWarfare\u201d \n01:20:08 Finger Length Ratios, Prenatal Hormone Exposure & Sexual Orientation \n01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms with Sexual Orientation \n01:32:00 \u201cOlder Brother Effects\u201d: Male Fetuses Might Change Mothers & Subsequent Brothers \n01:35:06 The Path Forward & A Warning\n01:35:55 Support & Your Questions \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shapes our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.\n\n#HubermanLab #Emotions #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nExpressVPN - http://expressvpn.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - http://magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nLinks:\nNSDR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo\nMood Meter App - https://moodmeterapp.com/\nAdolescence and The Brain - https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770\nVagus and Depression - https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/lighting-the-brain\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:05:10 Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link \n00:07:40 Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable  \n00:10:53 To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy & Puberty  \n00:15:21 Your First Feeling Was Anxiety \n00:17:36 What Are \u201cHealthy Emotions\u201d?  \n00:19:03 Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App \n00:21:08 The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself \n00:24:00 You Are An Infant: Bonds & Predictions \n00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment  \n00:32:40 \u201cGlue Points\u201d Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written) \n00:36:34 \u201cEmotional Health\u201d: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic \n00:37:50 An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias \n00:42:19 Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture  \n00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive \n00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: The Leptin Connection \n00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage  \n00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent \n00:58:26 Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists & Testing Emotional Bonds \n01:00:25 Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal \n01:07:48 Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet \n01:11:05 \u201cRight-Brain Versus Left-Brain People\u201d: Facts Versus Lies  \n01:14:18 Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness \n01:16:15 How To Recognize \u201cRight Brain Activity\u201d In Speech: Prosody \n01:18:32 Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States \n01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Are Not For \u201cEmpathy\u201d, Maybe For Predicting Behavior  \n01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy \n01:27:00 Ways To Increase Oxytocin \n01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities \n01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body \n01:35:18 A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range & Depth of Emotional Experience \n01:30:43 MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework \n01:38:54 Roundup, Various Forms of Support \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "short_description": "This episode explains what stress is, and how it recruits our brain and body to react in specific ways. I describe the three main types of stress, and how two of them actually enhance the function of our immune system making us less vulnerable to infections. I review tools that allow us to control our stress in real-time, as well as tools to prevent long-term stress, burnout and stress-induced illness and anxiety. As always, we cover behavioral tools and supplements that can assist or hinder stress control.\n\n#HubermanLab #Stress #Neuroscience\n\nFor an updated list of our current sponsors, please visit our website as previous sponsors mentioned in this podcast episode may no longer be affiliated with us: https://hubermanlab.com/sponsors\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nTimestamps below.\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:04:41 Emotions: A Logical Framework of Brain-Body Loops \n00:10:29 Stress: The (Falsely Narrow) Animal Attack Narrative \n00:14:31 The Stress RESPONSE: Generic, Channels blood, Biases Action \n00:21:08 Tools to Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness or Increase Calm  \n00:24:15 The Fastest Way to Reduce Stress In Real Time: \u201cRespiratory Sinus Arrhythmia\u201d  \n00:29:45 The Fastlane to Calm \n00:34:53 Important Notes About Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag \n00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing For Calm and Sleep Induction \n00:37:57 Nasal Breathing For Cosmetic, Immune and Performance Enhancement \n00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers In The Brain \n00:39:45 Breathing For Speaking Clearly  \n00:40:39 The 3 Types of Stress: Short, Medium and Long-Term  \n00:42:10 Positive Effects of Short-Term Stress: Immunity and Focus \n00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells  \n00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing IS Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation  \n00:50:58 Inflammation Is Useful and Good, In the Short Term \n00:52:02 Procrastination and Self-Manufactured Nootropics \n00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness  \n00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol \n00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: A Clear Definition \n00:56:07 Stress Threshold \n00:57:10 Stress Inoculation Tools: Separating Mind & Body, On Purpose \n00:59:50 Use Vision to Calm the Mind When the Body Is Agitated \n01:02:36 Beyond NSDR \n01:04:36 Long Term Stress: Definition, Measurement, Cardiovascular Risks  \n01:06:30 Tools for Dealing With Long Term Stress \n01:08:20 The Oxytocin Myth \n01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety  \n01:12:00 Delight and Flexibility  \n01:13:30 Chemical Irritants We Make But Can Control: Tackykinin  \n01:15:40 Impactful Gratitude  \n01:16:25 Non-Prescription Chemical Compounds For Additional Anti-Stress Support  \n01:18:04 Melatonin: Cautionary Note About Adrenal Suppression \n01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Is A Myth\u2026 But Why You Need to Know About It Anyway \n01:21:10 L-Theanine For Stress Reduction and Task Completion Anxiety \n01:23:00 Beware Taurine and Energy Drinks With Taurine \n01:23:30 Ashwagandha: Can Powerfully Lower Anxiety And Cortisol  \n01:25:50 Examine.com Is An Amazing Free Resource  \n01:26:20 How This All Relates to Emotions: State Versus Demand = Valence \n01:32:00 Modulating Reactivity, Mindfulness, & Functionality With Objective Tools \n01:34:00 Next Steps  \n01:35:40 Topic Suggestions, Subscriptions and Reviews Please \n01:37:40 Additional Resources, Synthesis\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I frame this in the context of our daily 24-hour cycle in order to make it practical, clear and precise about timing. I review the role of fasting, meal timing and specific types of nutrients for promoting certain states of mind. I also review various other tools and biological factors that directly or indirectly gate brain function and that we can control. I answer commonly asked questions about the science of psychedelics, binaural beats, and visualization.

    "short_description": "This episode explains the science of motivation and drive. I describe how dopamine, a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.\n\n#HubermanLab #Motivation #Neuroscience\n\nFor an updated list of our current sponsors, please visit our website as previous sponsors mentioned in this podcast episode may no longer be affiliated with us: https://hubermanlab.com/sponsors\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nLink to study:\nEffects of expectation on specificity of stimulant effects: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33734725/\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:04:22 Announcement: Spanish Subtitles \n00:05:06 Emotions, Addiction & Mindset \n00:06:22 Motivation & Movement: The Dopamine Connection \n00:07:29 A Double-Edged Dopamine Blade \n00:08:56 Dopamine Fundamentals: Precursor to Adrenalin \n00:10:15 The Reward Pathway: An Accelerator & A Brake \n00:12:10 Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain \n00:14:14 The Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine \n00:16:15 Subjective Control of Dopamine Release \n00:17:40 Social Media and Video Games \n00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns \n00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation \n00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails  \n00:23:11 Desire Scales With Pain: The Yearning Function \n00:24:43 The Croissant Craving Circuit \n00:25:45 \u201cHere and Now\u201d Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus \n00:26:26 In Your Skin Or Out In the World \n00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness \n00:28:15 The Almond Meditation\n00:29:30 Drugs That Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception \n00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation \n00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine, Prescription Drugs \n00:37:04 When Enough Is Never Enough; How Dopamine Undermines Itself\n00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods \n00:40:30 The Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression of Prolactin  \n00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc As Mild Prolactin Inhibitors \n00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity and Side Effects of Anti-Dopaminergic Drugs \n00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction \u201cLows\u201d & Extending the Arc of Dopamine \n00:48:00 The Chemistry of \u201cI Won, But Now What?\u201d \n00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child and Parent \n00:50:03 Never Say \u201cMaybe\u201d (Reward Prediction Error)\n00:52:02 Surprise! \n00:52:59 Are You Suppressing Your Drive and Motivation By Working Too Late?\n00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure and Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy \n00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine  \n01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity \n01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules \n01:05:22 Subjective Control of Dopamine and Drug Effects: The \u201cAdderall\u201d Experiment \n01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills Them \n01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase \n01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad and Good) \n01:14:14 Intermittent Halting of Celebration; Enjoy Your Wins, But Not All of Them \n01:18:38 A Story Example of Intermittent Reward to Maintain Long-Term Drive and Motivation \n01:21:25 Corrections & Notes About Spanish Captions & Other Languages Soon \n01:24:00 Synthesis & Framework, Zero-Cost Support & A Note About Sponsors \n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss REM-associated dreams that control emotional learning and their similarity to various trauma treatments such as ketamine and EMDR. I also discuss Non-REM dreams and their role in motor learning and learning of detailed, non-emotionally-laden information. I relate this to science-backed tools for accessing more of the types of sleep and learning people may want. Other topics are listed in the time stamps below.

    "short_description": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast. I am Dr. Andrew Huberman. \n\nMy plan in creating this podcast is to discuss neuroscience: how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body controls our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health. I will also discuss tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works.\n\nUpcoming episodes will cover: sleep and how to get better at sleeping, learning, dreaming, as well as motivation and focus and how to access more focus. We will also cover neuroplasticity, fear, and stress.\n\nAlong the way, I will discuss behavioral tools (\"do's and don'ts\"), and the role of nutrition, exercise, supplements, prescription drugs and electronic devices for measuring and changing the way our nervous systems work.\n\nTo suggest additional topics, please enter them in the comment section below. Also, be sure to \"like\" any comments suggesting topics you're interested in. I will shape the content of future podcasts accordingly.\n\nThank you for your interest in science!\n\n-Andrew\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",
